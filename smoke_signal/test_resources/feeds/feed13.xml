      <title>A Humanitarian Crisis in Haiti After Hurricane Matthew (30 photos)</title>
      <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/theatlantic/infocus/~3/YB3ptElbWzs/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hurricane Matthew killed more than 500 people in Haiti when it struck two weeks ago, leaving more than 175,000 without homes, and more than a million more struggling to survive in what United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called "absolute devastation." The UN estimates at least 1.4 million Haitians are now in need of urgent assistance as clean water, food, and medicine are in short supply, and an ongoing cholera epidemic threatens to worsen and spread after dozens of cholera treatment centers were destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s time once again for a look at the animal kingdom and our interactions with the countless species that share our planet. Today’s photos include an elephant with a prosthetic leg, a Hungarian horseman, a glass squid from Hawaii, fireflies in Mexico, pangolins in Indonesia, rescue operations for a number of animals, a fennec fox in a Bangkok cafe, and much more. These images and many others are part of this roundup of animals in the news from recent months, seen from the perspectives of their human observers, companions, captors, and caretakers, as part of an ongoing series on &lt;a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/photo/categories/animals/"&gt;animals in the news&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bollywood is known for its sumptuous costumes, elaborate dances, and catchy songs. &lt;a href="http://www.markbennington.com/"&gt;Mark Bennington&lt;/a&gt; was interested in something else: What did the Indian acting community look like off the screen? His new book, &lt;a href="http://www.livingthedreambollywood.com/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Living the Dream: The Life of the 'Bollywood' Actor&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, features interviews and photographs of 112 personalities, from students to superstars. They are pictured reading their lines on the train, sipping falooda, and trying to make it in Mumbai. The interviews have been condensed and edited for clarity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Siberian Mammoth Pirates (12 photos)</title>
      <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/theatlantic/infocus/~3/7dGcKDbFfIA/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In Russia’s Siberian wilderness, a new gold rush is on, as local ‘tuskers’ evade police and set up temporary illegal ivory mines, blasting away soil and permafrost to find the tusks, horns, and bones of long-extinct woolly mammoths and rhinos. Demand for ivory remains huge in China and other Asian nations, and the market for elephant tusks is tightening as preservation efforts increase. A large mammoth tusk—“ethical ivory”—can be worth tens of thousands of dollars to a lucky tusker. Photographer &lt;a href="http://www.amoschapplephoto.com/"&gt;Amos Chapple&lt;/a&gt;, working for Radio Free Europe / Radio Liberty, traveled to Russia’s Yakutia region with some of these tuskers, documenting their search, the environmental impact, and some of their finds. Be sure to see his &lt;a href="http://www.rferl.org/a/the-mammoth-pirates/27939865.html"&gt;full story at Radio Free Europe / Radio Liberty&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;figcaption&gt;
                This 65-kilogram mammoth tusk, photographed a moment after it was plucked from the permafrost, was sold for $34,000. The two men who found it unearthed three more in just over a week, including one weighing 72 kilograms.

      <title>The Wreckage Left Behind by Hurricane Matthew (34 photos)</title>
      <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/theatlantic/infocus/~3/vakUYui2jPc/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;What remains of Hurricane Matthew is now a tropical depression moving out into the Atlantic Ocean. Matthew moved slowly northward from Haiti and Cuba to Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas, at peak, reaching sustained winds of 160 mph. One week after the powerful storm first made landfall in southwestern Haiti, some communities still have not received any assistance, as authorities there reported at least 900 deaths due to the hurricane. Another 33 people in the United States lost their lives as Matthew crashed ashore. Haiti now faces a humanitarian crisis with hundreds of thousands of residents in need of aid, housing, and medical attention, as a growing cholera outbreak threatens to make the situation even worse.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Looking for North Korea (20 photos)</title>
      <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/theatlantic/infocus/~3/GgHMK2JDLNA/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Photographer &lt;a href="http://www.fabianmuir.com/"&gt;Fabian Muir&lt;/a&gt; has traveled to North Korea five times over the past two years, visiting not only the &lt;a href="http://foreignpolicy.com/slideshow/the-land-of-no-smiles/"&gt;much-photographed&lt;/a&gt; capital city of Pyongyang, but more than a dozen other smaller towns. Photographing North Korea remains a challenging task due to restrictions placed on all visitors, especially photographers. Two or three &lt;a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/03/its-not-a-hermit-kingdom-and-4-other-myths-about-north-korea/274488/"&gt;government minders&lt;/a&gt; accompanied Muir whenever he left his hotel, steering him while acting as guides. Under these restrictions, Fabian &lt;a href="https://www.lensculture.com/articles/fabian-muir-intimate-perspectives-on-north-korea"&gt;tried to show&lt;/a&gt; as much of North Korean life as he could, balancing images heavy with statues, monuments, and mass performances in Pyongyang with more intimate shots of farmers and children in outlying villages.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Foula, Scotland—the Most Remote Inhabited Island in Great Britain (25 photos)</title>
      <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/theatlantic/infocus/~3/uwStgiaFrus/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Foula Island, part of Scotland’s Shetland Islands, is home to a population of only thirty people who primarily earn their living as sheep and pony farmers. The island has been owned by the Holbourn family for the past hundred years. Growing numbers of visitors are making their way to Foula as bird watchers from around the world come to see its puffins, skuas, razorbills, gannets, and more. Getty Images photographer Jeff Mitchell paid a visit to Foula recently, and returned with these images of its people, animals, and landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Harrowing Scenes From the Mediterranean as Migrants Risk Everything for a Chance at a Better Life (23 photos)</title>
      <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/theatlantic/infocus/~3/srU4fUsw0Xc/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hundreds of thousands of migrants from Africa and the Middle East continue to make their way to Europe, fleeing poverty, war, and chaos in their home countries. More than 3,000 are known to have died on the journey across the Mediterranean Sea this year alone. Thousands are now racing to make the dangerous crossing before summer ends, as European authorities and non-governmental organizations struggle to rescue and accommodate the influx. Agence France-Presse photographer &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ArisMessinis"&gt;Aris Messinis&lt;/a&gt; recently spent time aboard rescue vehicles documenting just some of the thousands of desperate migrants plucked from smuggler’s boats left drifting in the Mediterranean over the past few days.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>2016 National Geographic Nature Photographer of the Year Contest  (25 photos)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;National Geographic Magazine has opened its annual &lt;a href="http://photography.nationalgeographic.com/nature-photographer-of-the-year-2016/" target="_new"&gt;photo contest&lt;/a&gt;, with the deadline for submissions coming up on November 4. The Grand Prize Winner will receive a 10-day trip for two to the Galapagos Islands. The kind folks at National Geographic were once more kind enough to let me choose among the contest entries so far for display here. The captions below were written by the individual photographers.&lt;/p&gt;

                "Territorial Hippo." I was on a photographic safari in Chobe River, Botswana in April 2016 when I took this image. At this time of the year the water levels are high and herds of hippopotamus share the tributaries. This particular bull was very territorial and liked to mock charge whenever our boat (driven by a qualified local guide) passed his patch of the river on our daily outings. On this occasion, I pre-focussed my 600mm lens and fired a few shots at a safe distance and got this golden hour shot!

      <title>Building Human Towers in Spain (22 photos)</title>
      <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/theatlantic/infocus/~3/3jBb_wXjp_Q/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Every year in Spain, a Catalan tradition of building Castells—human towers reaching up to 10 stories—takes place. Teams called colles compete to build the tallest and most complex tower made only of human beings standing atop one another. Teams are considered to have been successful if they can build and deconstruct their towers without a fall.&lt;/p&gt;

        
        &lt;figure&gt;

      <title>All Is Water: The Global Crisis in Photographs (15 photos)</title>
      <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/theatlantic/infocus/~3/4UsZtWOyyNE/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mustafahabdulaziz.com/"&gt;Mustafah Abdulaziz &lt;/a&gt;has spent the last five years examining humanity's relationship to one of the most basic and precious natural resources: water. Traveling to nine countries, Abdulaziz photographed the polluted rivers of Brazil, the fisheries of China, and the elaborate sewers of New York City for his essay “&lt;a href="https://www.thewaterhub.org/waterstories"&gt;Water Stories&lt;/a&gt;.” His work was supported in part with funding from Earthwatch, WaterAid, WWF, and HSBC's Water Programme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While ostensibly organized around the oceans, wells, and wetlands of the world, the images touch upon many complicated topics, including mineral extraction, energy, natural disaster, population growth, and climate change. “There, amidst nearly every major challenge facing our planet, was water itself, the subject and the stage,” Abdulaziz said. “It was a resource whose existence reaches back to our origins and whose health will determine our future.” Sixty-eight of his images from are currently on display in New York City on the &lt;a href="http://www.photoville.com/water-stories-a-photographic-exhibition/"&gt;East River waterfront&lt;/a&gt; until October 12.  &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>On the Border (32 photos)</title>
      <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/theatlantic/infocus/~3/GpWtz2NoKbU/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The border between the United States and Mexico has become a major issue in the upcoming presidential election. It stretches 3,169 kilometers (1,969 miles), crossing deserts, rivers, towns, and cities from the Pacific to the Gulf of Mexico. Every year, an estimated 350 million people legally cross the border, with some 400,000 entering into the United States illegally. No single barrier stretches across the entire border, instead, it is lined with a patchwork of steel and concrete fences, infrared cameras, sensors, drones, and nearly 20,000 U.S. Border Patrol agents. Getty Images photographer John Moore has covered many miles of the border over recent years, capturing images of surveillance, escapes, arrests, detentions, and encounters between those crossing the border and those securing it.&lt;/p&gt;

The U.S. Border Patrol, however, tightly controls the San Diego side and only allows visitors to speak to loved ones through the fence during restricted weekend hours at "Friendship Park, which straddles the border.

      <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/theatlantic/infocus/~3/F-lT_DHhD2Y/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For thousands of years, when farmers in mountainous regions have expanded their farms to grow crops on the steep slopes, they have carved massive steps into the terrain, forming terraces of many small platforms. Following the contours of the mountains, the edges of the terraces create sinuous patterns in the landscape, presenting picturesque images. Gathered here are photos from China, Switzerland, Vietnam, Peru, the Philippines, and Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Fall Is in the Air (24 photos)</title>
      <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/theatlantic/infocus/~3/FdoTurOj15M/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s starting to feel like my favorite time of year once more—the autumnal equinox took place last week, marking the end of summer and the start of fall across the Northern Hemisphere. Autumn is the season of harvests, festivals, migrations, winter preparations, and of course, spectacular foliage. Across the north, people are just beginning to feel a crisp chill in the evening air, leaves are splashing mountainsides with bright color, apples and pumpkins are being gathered, and animals are on the move. Collected here are some early images from this year's autumn—more will come later as the season unfolds.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Rejecting the Deadbeat Dad Stereotype (13 photos)</title>
      <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/theatlantic/infocus/~3/js_eWr5OXo4/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Photographer &lt;a href="http://phyllisbdooney.com/"&gt;Phyllis B. Dooney&lt;/a&gt; was introduced to East New York, a low-income Brooklyn neighborhood, by way of a marching band. Rather than running home to a traditional nuclear family, the students she photographed would spend evenings with their aunts, with their grandmothers, or shuttling between their mom’s and dad's separate houses or apartments. Communities like this are often condemned by the media as having broken homes. But Dooney wanted to explore what parenting, specifically fatherhood, really looked like when adults and children alike are grappling with "the long-term societal and psychological effects of mass incarceration, the War on Drugs and the 1980s crack epidemic, and frequent exposure to crime and trauma."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She interviewed and took portraits of these men in their homes, often with their children, and utilized &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera_obscura"&gt;camera obscuras&lt;/a&gt; to project the streets into their private spaces. "The men seen here expose how the 'deadbeat Dad' label—often stapled to the American inner-city Black man and men of color in particular—is a gross and counter-productive simplification," Dooney said.&lt;/p&gt;

My little one, she gets scared of the dark: ‘You don’t have to be scared because Daddy is here.’ Just knowing that I am there for them makes me feel like I accomplished a lot.”

      <title>Before Beijing: A Rare View of China's Last Dynasty (20 photos)</title>
      <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/theatlantic/infocus/~3/BkSxa2qiEig/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In May of 1870, Thomas Child was hired by the Imperial Maritime Customs Service to be a gas engineer in Peking (Beijing). The 29-year-old Englishman left behind his wife and three children to become one of roughly 100 foreigners living in the late Qing dynasty's capital, taking his camera along with him. Over the course of the next 20 years, he took some 200 photographs, capturing the earliest comprehensive catalog of the customs, architecture, and people during China's last dynasty. On Thursday, an exhibition of his images will open at the&lt;a href="http://www.baruch.cuny.edu/wsas/artsculture/mishkingallery/current.html"&gt; Sidney Mishkin Gallery&lt;/a&gt; in New York, curated by Stacey Lambrow. In addition, descendants of the subjects of one of his most famous images, &lt;em&gt;Bride and Bridegroom&lt;/em&gt; (1870s), will be in attendance.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Bore Tides of the Qiantang River (20 photos)</title>
      <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/theatlantic/infocus/~3/7WxliwmN7ZE/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For hundreds of years, on the eighth month of the lunar calendar, people have gathered along the shores of China’s Qiantang River at the head of Hangzhou Bay to witness the waves of its famous bore tide. Higher-than-normal high tides push into the harbor, funneling into the river, causing a broad wave that can reach up to 30 feet high. If the waves surge over the banks, spectators can be swept up, pushed along walkways or down embankments. Below, I’ve gathered images from the past few years of the Qiantang bore tides.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Far From the War, Yemen's Remote Mountain Villages (21 photos)</title>
      <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/theatlantic/infocus/~3/-Z6EFFJPkKI/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For nearly two years now, Yemen has been torn by a ferocious war involving rebel forces, extremist groups, government militias, and foreign bombing campaigns. For the majority of Yemenis who live in the countryside, far from the centers of fighting, life was difficult to begin with, and for many, the war has had little impact. Reuters photographer Abduljabbar Zeyad &lt;a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-security-village-idUSKCN11I1E1"&gt;recently traveled&lt;/a&gt; to western Yemen to photograph the lives of some of these villagers as they work, study, and play, high on Dhalamlam Mountain.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Building a 13th-Century Castle in the 21st Century (21 photos)</title>
      <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/theatlantic/infocus/~3/c0S35eB14Ps/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Guedelon Castle is a project started in 1997 by Michel Guyot and Maryline Martin in the Burgundy region of France. The castle is styled on typical French medieval chateau-fort, modeled on designs from the 13th century, and is being built using techniques and materials available to masons and builders 800 years ago. The Guedelon project has now become a tourist destination, and employs dozens of workers. The castle is due to be completed in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
