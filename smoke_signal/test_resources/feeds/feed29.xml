        <![CDATA[<p><br /><br /><br /><em>Pacific Standard</em>. Get it? It's like <em>The Atlantic</em>, but it's Pacific. Totally different. So unlike <em>The Atlantic</em>, it will "attack the conventional wisdom from a west coast perspective." That's a quote. "But didn't the editors come from <em>The Atlantic</em>?" Yes. "So what's the diff? Does west coast imply the writers will be better looking?" The women will be, unless they write about gender issues, then they will appear gendered. The men will look wise if they're crushing on social science, or tough and no-nonsense if they're hating on Republicans. Don't worry, pics of the writers will be included to suggest an appeal to authority. "Hold on, is the owner of this magazine Sara Miller McCune? The same woman who is responsible for those atrocious SAGE journals like <em>Psychological Science</em> and <em>Evolutionary Perspectives On Human Development</em> that charge CV padding post-docs a few hundred dollars to publish linkbait like "Ovulating Women Prefer Men With Large Sneakers", that Malcolm Gladwell and media outlets like <em>Pacific Standard</em> then cross promote as valid science?" Yes, but I'm sure it's a coincidence. "This magazine sounds terrible." Duh.</p>
<p>This cover story details #young #vulnerable #feminist writer Amanda Hess's frustration with disinterested male law enforcement when, after writing an article about receiving rape threats from a troll, she received rape threats from a troll. I sympathize, though in my experience what's even more frightening than a guy telling you he's going to rape you is a guy not telling you he's going to rape you.</p>
<p>There's a big push for "women's safety" online, for getting rid of trolls and cyberbullies and cyberstalkers, not coincidentally another one of Randi Zuckerberg's pet causes; and while these are all legitimate worries someone should take a minute and ask why, when mustached men have been stalking women since the days of Whitecastle yet no systemic changes have been effected, the moment women feel threatened from the safety of their LCD screens America opens the nuclear briefcase. No one finds that suspicious?<br /><br />In fact, regular stalking is barely ever mentioned in media, no matter how many times the guy was laying under her new boyfriend's front porch on Wednesday nights after Organic Chemistry class, what drives the article is "and then he stalked her on Facebook!"<br /><br /></p>
<blockquote>Here's just a sampling of the noxious online commentary directed at other women in recent years. To Alyssa Royse, a sex and relationships blogger, for saying that she hated The Dark Knight: "you are clearly retarded, i hope someone shoots then rapes you." To Kathy Sierra, a technology writer, for blogging about software, coding, and design: "i hope someone slits your throat and cums down your gob." To Lindy West, a writer at the women's website Jezebel, for critiquing a comedian's rape joke: "I just want to rape her with a traffic cone." To Rebecca Watson, an atheist commentator, for blogging about sexism in the skeptic community: "If I lived in Boston I'd put a bullet in your brain." To Catherine Mayer, a journalist at Time magazine, for no particular reason: "A BOMB HAS BEEN PLACED OUTSIDE YOUR HOME. IT WILL GO OFF AT EXACTLY 10:47 PM ON A TIMER AND TRIGGER DESTROYING EVERYTHING."</blockquote>
<p><br /><br />As the recipient of not zero decapitation emails I admit it does make you curious about whether or not you can buy an alligator, but while you're arming your windows like a <em>Saw</em> movie you should contemplate the difference between what should be done and why it appears something should be done. <br /><br />I.<br /><br />The force for this change isn't coming from safety or ethics. Neither is it activism. If you see any group advocating influentially for change in a media they don't own or control, you can double down and split the 10s, the dealer is holding status and quo. No change is possible on someone else's dime, and if what looks like a supermodel approaches you with a microphone and a camera crew, you should run like she's Johnny Carcosa. On occasion what the activists think they want may happen coincidentally to align with what the system wants, and from that moment on they will be lead to believe they are making a difference, which means they're making money for someone else. "Your writing is so muddled." Sorry. Were you better <em>persuaded</em> by the concise prose of Amanda Hess? <br /><br />Her article seems to be about what could be done to stop anonymous trolls from terrorizing and threatening women. How about prosecuting them, since terroristic threats is already a crime? Unfortunately, as Hess discovers, the police don't care much about online stalking, which is consistent since they don't care about IRL stalking either. But never mind, it's not the problem: misogyny is the problem, amplified 1000x by online anonymity. Anonymity makes the internet mean and gives trolls= men too much power. This is the subtle shift: what starts out as "misogyny is bad" becomes "anonymity facilitates misogyny."<br /><br />Keeping in mind that actual stalking has never been dealt with in any significant way ever, the desire of a few female writers to curb online anonymity wouldn't be enough to get an @ mention, except that this happens to coincide with what the media wants, and now we have the two vectors summing to form a public health crisis. "Cyberbullying is a huge problem!" Yes, but not because it is hurtful, HA! no one cares about your feelings-- but because criticism makes women want to be more private-- and the privacy of the women is bad. The women have to be online, they do most of the clicking and receive most of the clicks. Anonymous cyberbullying is a barrier to increasing consumption, it's gotta go.<br /><br />II.<br /><br />You may at this point roll your eyes epileptically and retort, "well, who cares 'what the system wants', the fact is anonymity does embolden the lunatics, shouldn't we try to restrict it?" <strong>Great</strong> question, too bad it's irrelevant. You've taken the bait and put all your energy into accepting the form of the argument. <em>The issue isn't whether we should abolish online anonymity, since this will never happen</em>. For every American senator trying to curb anonymity there's going to be a Scandinavian cyberpirate who will come up with a workaround, and only one of them knows how to code. Besides, there's no power in abolishing anonymity, the power is in giving everyone the pretense of anonymity while secretly retaining the PGP keys to the kingdom.<br /><br />To understand what's really happening, start from basics: if you're reading it, it's for you. I assume you're not a cyberbully or a stalker. So do you have any power to abolish anonymity?<br /><br />If Hess has made you wonder, hmm, maybe unrestricted anonymity is bad because it gives trolls too much power, then the system has successfully used her for its true purpose: <em>brand it as bad, to you</em>. She is <em>unwittingly</em> teaching the demo of this article, e.g. women in their 20s with no actual power looking to establish themselves, who are the very people who should embrace anonymity, not to want this: only rapists and too-weak-to-try rapists want to be anonymous. Smart women write clickable articles about their sexuality for nothing, because what good are you if you can't make someone else money? Interesting to observe that the article's single suggested solution to cyberharassment is to reframe a criminal problem into a civil rights issue using a logic so preposterously adolescent that if you laid this on your Dad when you were 16 he'd backhand slap you right out of the glee club: "it discourages women from writing and earning a living online." Earning a living? From who, Gawker? Most of the women writing on the internet are writing for someone else who pays them next to nothing. None of them control the capital, none of them get paid 1/1000 of what they bring in for the media company. You know what they do get? They get to be valued by work, and in gratitude they are going to the front lines to fight for the media company's right to pay them less.</p>
<p>And the indoctrination has worked, the less Asperger's a woman is, the more she'll hate writing anonymously. Don't get angry at me, they did a study, and I think it explains why women don't want to write for <em>The Economist</em>. In the reverse, put a pic in your byline and you improve your female audience; put a pic of a female in your byline and you've maximized ROI, everyone will click on a pic of a chick. This is economic and psychologic universe in which Hess finds herself.</p>
<p>"But you can't use a pen name at places like <em>The New Yorker</em>. You know they pay their top staff writers $100k a year?" Jesus. a) yes you can; b) listen to me: if those swindlers are willing to pay you $100k, then you could probably get $200k yourself, and if you can't get $200k yourself then you aren't worth their $100k either and they will eventually notice. When they pay you that much they're not paying you to write for them, they're paying you not to write for anyone else, that's called controlling the capital.</p>
<p>"So your solution is that she should use pseudonym? Isn't that blaming the victim?" No, not her-- you. You should use a pseudonym. You aren't writing for Gawker, you just use the internet, comment on things, etc. Why should you use your real name? "Why shouldn't I?" I'm sorry, I wasn't precise: <em>why are you being encouraged to use your real name?</em> Again, the question of whether anonymity emboldens trolls is not the force of that article, it isn't about their behavior, it is about yours.</p>
<p>"But merely 'branding anonymity as bad' isn't going to stop the cyberbullying misogynists." You are correct, which is why the spokesperson for this crisis is Amanda Hess. <em>No one is trying to stop cyberbullies</em>, there's no point, they don't shop and no one wants to look at them. Hess has entirely misunderstood what the medium wants. The whole game is to get <em>women</em>-- <em>not</em> the cyberbullies, <em>not</em> criminals, but the consumers-- to voluntarily give up all of their privacy, while paying lip service to privacy at home-- knowing full well women that women will pay money not to have the kind of privacy they have at home. Voluntarily exposing yourself makes you a targetable consumer and targetable consumable. Is it worth it?</p>
<p>III.</p>
<p>All of this is for the benefit of the media, which is why I know with 100% certainty that nothing will change. Because she wrote that article, because some people camped in Zuccotti Park, the energy for activity was discharged. And the media got all the profits.</p>
<p>What Hess didn't realize is that while she was fumbling impotently with the cops, the media company that she worked for could have crushed the troll if it was worth it <em>to them</em>. Did you have this thought? If not, it's not your fault, some people are trained not to have it while others were trained to have it immediately. Which are you? If the founder of <em>Religions For New Atheists</em> Sara Miller McCune herself had received an electronic rape threat from some Fox News stenographer in a Kentucky man cave, you think she's dialing 911? From her <em>apartment</em>? She would have waited until she got to <em>the office</em>, waved her hands like in <em>Minority Report</em> and her lawyers would have midnight Seal Team Sixed him while he was overhand jacking it to interracial porn. Do you know what Hess's employers did for her? No, I'm serious do you know? It can't be nothing, right? That would be Bananastown. It was nothing? Really?</p>
<p>Maybe hypotheticals aren't your bag, ok, here's a true story: "Amy" received a couple of voice messages from a "customer" she met at work who wanted to put something in her vagina. These messages were not violent, in so far as forcing your fantasies of consensual sex into an unwilling girl's ear is considered not violent, but of course they creeped her out. There's one other crucial piece of information needed to understand this story: her harasser probably had large sneakers. I'll give you all a minute to catch up.</p>
<p>Every woman has some version of this story, with one important difference: Amy was a medical student, which meant a lot of money went into her and a lot of money was expected of her. One (1) phone call from the Dean to a phone number that was not 911 and that guy was evaporated. Two cops located him minding his own business, and because he defended himself with the magic words-- and you should write these down, they're gold-- "it's a public street, I have a right to be here"-- <em>he was jailed for eight months</em> for harassment and resisting arrest-- <em>pre-trial</em>. Pre means without. Of course his case was ultimately dismissed. Does that matter? Please observe a) Amy herself didn't have to do anything to effect any of this, she was mostly unaware of the results, the system was on autopilot; b) he was jailed not for what he did but for whom he did it to, had Amy been a 1040EZ at the Footlocker we'd say she was asking for it. "But it isn't fair that her protection money should get her concierge policing while the rest of us have to make due with socialized law enforcement." Was it fair that he did eight months because he couldn't afford bail, is it fair that he didn't know that it wasn't fair? On the other hand, was he a dangerous nut, should he have been punished? Of course. Was he operating from a perspective of institutionalized sexism, patriarchal thinking, misogyny? Sure, #whatevs. Sometimes the structural imbalances go your way, and sometimes they don't, better figure out who makes the scales.</p>
<p>After Hess got the runaround, she spent a lot of time trying to get a protection order, a force slightly less compelling than wind. Why didn't she just call the Mayor? "Hi. I work for the city paper, the one that caters to voting Democrats and men looking for Russian companionship. I'm doing a story about police apathy regarding sexual violence from a first person perspective, by which I mean your perspective. Comment?" That would have solved her problem, but more importantly it would have forced her to think about WHY that solved her problem. What is the difference between a "woman" who is threatened and a "reporter" or "medical student" who is threatened? Why is it more bad to attack a journalist than a woman? Think about that, it has not always been so. The former is an attack on the system, so the system must respond; the latter is an attack on a woman, so -------------------------------------. And so it goes.</p>
<p>But Hess preferred to see misogyny on the internet, so instead we get another trending article about how the problem has a penis. This coincides perfectly with the media's desire to frame it as a gender war because that makes for good clicking. Let's summarize the media's thesis via unwitting Hess: 1. cyberharassment is a women's issue, never mind the men who are harassed. 2. The appropriate way to handle women's issues is not necessarily to solve them but to discuss them in the media. "It's called awareness." We are all aware. Are you aware of how much you made for <em>Pacific Standard</em> at your expense and to no avail?</p>
<p></p>
<p>IV.</p>
<p><br />Hess is fighting the battles of 50 years ago because she was told to fight them by people who profit from the fight, and as a bonus it gets her out of any self-criticism. Oh, Sheryl Sandberg thinks Silicon Valley can be a boys' club? Was that why she manned up and sold us out to the NSA? Curious that she didn't accuse the NSA of being a boys' club. Perhaps real power transcends gender? More curious/on purpose is that she and the boosters at <em>Wired</em> are more horrified about NSA spying, despite there being an explicit terms of service agreement with them that what it finds without a warrant is inadmissible, but Google monitoring my sexts for their commercial benefit is SAGE approved behavioral economics. Google buying Boston Dynamics is better than DARPA having it, is that the game we're playing now? If I had to put my chips and my children against an 8 year rotation of civil service nincompoops vs. some nerd with an open marriage who spent $15M on a "bachelor pad" so he could score chicks of questionable emotional stability, I'm going with the group my private sector lawyers have an outside chance of pwoning. "But how cool is that guy that he could spend $15M on scoring chicks!" You're looking at it backwards, the only way he could score chicks was by spending $15M, and now that guy owns cybernauts. Power corrupts, but absolute power doesn't exist, so for everything else, there's Mastercard.</p>
<p>What Hess and others fail to see is that this kind of postgraduate sexismology-- Hess's "ability" to see it-- <em>is encouraged because it favors the status quo</em>. It is a tool for maintaining an economic and psychological disavowal favorable to Gen X and older-- men and women. Their collective psychology has caused to be a machine that is calibrated to ensure their life is not disrupted-- at the expense of everyone under 30, you guys waste your life Banning Bossy and make sure you pay back all of your student loans, sorry about the future but the SLEEP/CONSUME machine from <em>They Live</em> has to keep running.</p>
<p>Here's a "class struggle" example: name one Wall Street type who went to jail post 2008, everyone picks Bernie Madoff. Now name one person <em>you know</em> who was harmed by Bernie Madoff. That's weird. Note he didn't <em>cause</em> the crash, his criminal empire was a "victim" of the crash. What got him jailed was stealing from the wrong people-- that the media coded as either "celebrities" or "pension funds". Look carefully at the result: you got a distraction to label as evil so you don't have to feel any guilt about overusing your credit card; the rich guys get (some of) their money back; and the media makes millions of dollars engaging you in a "conversation." "But he was symptomatic of Wall Street excesses." Way to treat the symptoms. Hence the most important result: nothing changed. The whole thing is a defense against change, for the system and for you. Still have that credit card at max?</p>
<p>Radical political action, radical as in "outside the frame" radical, the kind self-aggrandizing #OWS is incapable of, would be to demand Bernie Madoff be <em>released</em>, so that everyone would have to watch him in restaurants and hookers, an unignorable signal to the system and to yourself that things are not right. Not to settle for symbolism and scapegoats. But the media won't let this happen, they thrive on symbolism and scapegoats; and you won't let it happen as long as you can get an iphone.</p>
<p>So the system encourages women like Hess to "critique the patriarchy" or "bring awareness" because it stands no chance of moving the money, let alone the power, and also the media gets a cut. Meanwhile men all over the place are left questioning why their opportunities are just as limited but their answer can't be a glass ceiling. "Maybe it's reverse sexism!" Maybe your media is no different than her media, we'll see what kind of sexism there is when the robots replace all of you. What is both obscene and astonishing in its power is that this distraction is foisted on Millennials <em>by other Millennials</em>, they're fighting for the other team, precisely because the immensely hard work of work can be avoided by hoping the problem is sexism. Hess is frantically fighting against-- whom? Cyberbullies? Frat guys? Stand up comedians? What are the results she expects from this fight? The fight is a symptom of neurosis, frantic energy as a defense against impotence, frantic energy as a defense against change. "Why am I in the top 20% of intelligence but I'm running the register at a store whose products I can't afford?" Because trolls are preventing women from earning a living online? "So it's Reddit's fault!"</p>
<p>V.</p>
<p>There should be no controversy: a guy should never tell a girl he's going to rape her, online or not, kidding or not. I get that he's <em>probably</em> not serious, but there should be no instinct at all to defend such a jerk, and yet----- and yet that is precisely the instinct many people get. Men who have never wanted to threaten anyone read Hess's story and side with the troll. And Hess will agree: it is a massive number of people. So they're all misogynist jerks, too? No other explanation?</p>
<p>Yet a typical such "misogynist" probably has a wife and daughters whom he loves in a more equal way than sexists in the Whig party did. He is aware his daughter is a girl, he wants the best for her, he'd be thrilled if she became President, do you think he doesn't want her to have power/money/influence, more than any man? And of course he wouldn't want his daughter to receive such rape threats, but what's important is that he believes she <em>wouldn't-- she wouldn't deserve them.</em></p>
<p>There is plenty of existing sexism and [insert lip service here]. I do not deny or minimize it, the point here is to identify the self-imposed kind of oppression, instead of top down it is bottom up: impotence. <em>All of these choices, all of these products, all of that sex, all of that power-- why not me?</em></p>
<p>The troll and Hess have this feeling of impotence, which Hess easily finds to be the fault of patriarchy, which she uses interchangeably with class, except when that class is Sarah Miller McCune, then it's just patriarchy. The troll thinks the source of his impotence is "militant feminism", which also explains why he's not worrying about his daughter. She's not a woman, she's a person, i.e. like all American parents, he's raising her like a boy: school x 16, sports x 12, violin x 6, and for everything else there's LCDs. I don't know why he thinks his daughter will fare any better through the same machine that is failing his son, but I guess it's worth a shot. Of course, he probably won't be too happy if she becomes a "feminist"; e.g. living with a teenage Zosia Mamet drove David Mamet to the Republican Party. I'm going to go ahead and protect myself by saying that's a joke.</p>
<p>So in order to explain their otherwise irrational feeling of impotence, they pull from any of the<em> media-approved</em> categories of blame, depending on your news network: sexism, racism, feminism. The central importance of the media in <em>soliciting</em> their anger is totally lost on the older "activists" who still believe that the -ism is the primary force. They're enraged that a white Princeton student would dare to write that white privledge doesn't exist; they never wonder why they read it. They are at a loss to explain why the very same trolls who want to "rape" feminist bloggers are even more enraged that women in Saudi Arabia are forced to wear burqas. So do misogynists hate Arab men more than American women? Is there a hate hierarchy? Yet the media is unsurprisingly ambivalent about the burqa, the feminism risks an assertion of cultural priviledge so they'd just as soon not get involved. And to hell with George Bush who made us have to.</p>
<p>There was a time not long ago when the dumbest people in the world were polacks. Do you see any dumb polacks around today? What happened? "Awareness?" Do you think we all just learned "poles are just like us?" You think it was... education? Pole empowerment? Tolerance? The question is not how did we learn to get over that prejudice, but rather what purpose did it serve in the first place, why was it the preferred expression of hate of that time?</p>
<p></p>
<p>VI.</p>
<p>Hess had a chance to wonder about this, but the media's keyword list and her own personal psychology converge to make her prefer to see sexism. Against these force vectors she is powerless. The medium is the message, she just puts her byline at the top. Hess even looked for a "woman problem" at <em>The Economist</em> which I thought was going to be that there weren't enough women there because she cited the statistic that 77% of the writers are men, except that she then lamented that since there are no bylines you couldn't tell which ones were the men and the women, which was also bad. But she had something else in mind:</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In many ways, the magazine suffers from the same woman problem that plagues libertarianism more widely. <em>The Economist</em>'s central belief in "free trade and free markets" informs its one-size-fits all approach to its readership--the idea that women might actually want to consume news differently than men doesn't fit into this theoretically level global playing field. <br /><br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><br />Women consume news differently. True? Let's find out:</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>When I lived with a boyfriend who subscribed to <em>The Economist</em>, I'd pick up the magazine occasionally, scanning the table of contents for the odd piece that appealed to me--a dissection of the racial dynamics of American marriage, for example, or a takedown of U.S. sex offender laws. Typically, though, I'd flip straight to the book reviews, a space I discerned as a little more inclusive than the front of the book. I recently asked that guy whether the contents of the magazine ever struck him as particularly masculine, too. "It's called <em>The Economist</em>," he replied. "It's like <em>Maxim</em> for nerds."</p>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>Lord have mercy.</p>
<p>First of all, <em>Maxim</em> is already for nerds, who else would want to look at glamour shots of still dressed women only women have heard of? This month is Sophia Bush and Olympic figure skater Tara Lipinski, yum, time to get your hard on. "Oh I loved her with Johnny Weir covering Sochi!" Can't say Maxim doesn't know its demographic.</p>
<p></p>
<h6 style="text-align: center;"><img alt="usweekly-maxim link.jpg" src="http://thelastpsychiatrist.com/images/usweekly-maxim%20link.jpg" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" height="604" width="400" />this is what women are told men want; this is how women are told how to want</h6>
<p></p>
<p>So for him to think <em>Maxim</em> isn't for nerds means he thinks it's for Dude-Bros, i.e. large genitaled males who get to rape all the drunk chicks at the Delta house. Which means he's an easy mark for branding, and which, I am willing to bet $10M, is why he tells his guy friends about <em>Maxim</em> but shows his girlfriend he subscribes to <em>The Economist</em>. Don't worry, Amanda, he only reads the book reviews, too. Stab in the dark, here's a guess at his character sketch: a smart underachiever, proud he's "not some frat jerk", he knows he's supposed to be interested in topics not related to him but finds his concentration isn't up to the task-- so he reassures himself with the trappings/magazines of intelligence. "Would Adderall help me do more work and less porn?" No, but it will help you write a book of porn and you will be terrified at what you learn. His favorite way to consume news is to forgo primary sources in favor of skimming two paragraph dissections written by others who also forwent the primary sources. Unmotivated, unthreatening and unrelevant, publicly not drawing from the system according to his need but privately disavowing a lack of contribution back to the system according to his ability. "But the system is corrupt." $100M says there's a vaporizer nearby.</p>
<p>Second of all: hell yeah, <em>dissections and takedowns</em>, <em>thank you for your consideration</em>.</p>
<p>Third of all: observe that she asked him about The Economist <em>after they had broken up</em>. Her ex was her go-to guy when she had a question about masculinity, and magazines. Does she know any other men? Has she interacted with any men without the polarized glasses of stereotype, prejudice and fear? Is every guy only either a love interest or a Dude-Bro?</p>
<p>Fourth: she misunderstood/completely understood his answer about whether the magazine was particularly masculine: "It's called <em>The Economist</em>." Uh oh. If I ask, "Is <em>Cosmo Magazine</em> particularly feminine?" and you reply, "Duh, stupid, it's called <em>Cosmo,</em> any more feminine and it would have a tailbone tattoo," then you are implying not only that the magazine is feminine, but that I should have been able to infer that because <em>cosmos</em> are feminine. To him, <em>The Economist</em> is masculine is because <em>economics</em> is intrinsically masculine-- <em>and she implicitly accepts this</em>. Now who's the sexist? Whose theoretical daughters have a better chance of learning economics? Of course she'd say any women <em>can</em> learn economics, yay women, but her daughters would be learning a masculine discipline, see also math, which I predict she's bad at. The barrier is in herself, sexism is merely her projection of it.</p>
<p>So while she pretends that it is the male perspective she doesn't like, it is evident that it's the contents themselves that she objects to. They're boring, but that can't be related to intellectual curiosity because she's a thinker. So it has to be the "male perspective". But didn't the same male perspective write the takedowns and dissections? Books, sex, relationships; those are "inclusive to women". What happens when you don't sign up for NATO-- that's masculine. But is it? Really? I agree that most of the articles in <em>The Economist</em> are boring and don't "relate" to my lifestyle as an alcoholic, but I force myself to go through them like social studies homework, and most of the women who do the same are doing it as the same. The articles aren't supposed to be interesting to me, they are supposed to be important and I force myself to be interested.</p>
<p>However, the point isn't that she should read <em>The Economist</em>, the point here is that she saw sexism, which means she didn't notice this:</p>

<p>UNWITTINGLY, perhaps, Vladimir Putin is playing Cupid to America's Mars and Europe's Venus. ... "I have not felt this good about transatlantic relations in a long time," whispers one senior European politician.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>WTF, why would anyone whisper this? Is Putin standing right there? <em>The Economist</em> does this all the time, citing unnamed sources while alluding to their power and significance. Of course the easy critique to make, and even this one Hess was not allowed to formulate, is that in this way <em>The Economist</em> conveys the impression that it has personal access to the levers of power, the way <em>Us Weekly</em> recasts publicists as "sources close to Kim Kardashian", shrinking the gap between the magazine and the sources and artificially widening the distance between Kardashian and us. She becomes more important and less accessible-- except through <em>Us Weekly</em>.</p>
<p>But this critique is backwards, it assumes the magazine is trying to trick its audience, this is wrong, the audience is using the magazine to trick itself. The audience wants this distance. It wants heroes, celebrities, people with power-- <em>it wants an upper class</em>-- and it wants them inaccessible. Envy? No, that's advertising, this is the "news." This is what happens when a whole generation's narcissism is threatened with injury-- <em>since everything is possible, why aren't you enjoying everything?</em>-- the personality structure becomes overwhelmingly defensive. "If I were Kim Kardashian, then I would be able to do X!" is NOT envy, flip it over and read the redacted obverse: "Only Kim Kardsahian<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>s</em></span> can do X -- therefore it's not my fault that I can't!"</p>
<p><em>The Economist</em> demo appears to want this same defense. The real trick of <em>The Economis</em>t is that as a magazine of "libertarianism" [sic], its <em>belief</em> in "free trade and free markets" requires as axiomatic that these are not real. The Invisible Hand is actually attached to a benevolent class of gentlemen capitalists who have the money, the connections, and the <em>information </em>to best mold the world. You don't know these people, but fortunately <em>The Economist</em> does. Their motto, inscribed in runes over a blue moongate on Jekyll Island, is, "<em>Be content to bind them by laws of trade. You have always done it. And let this be your reason</em>."</p>
<p>Why would the <em>The Economist</em>'s rich and powerful demo want to be ruled? Because they aren't powerful, only rich, all that time getting rich did not translate to any power, only the trappings of power. So they've postulated a fantasy power structure/NBA owners that explains why they can't enjoy their lives as they think they should-- to absolve themselves of the guilt they feel for having money/intellect/opportunities and NOT being able to do anything with it except spend it on the system-wide approved gimmicks: Trading Up, college educations, the National Bank of S&amp;P 500.</p>
<p>And you say, boo hoo for the rich. That's your media approved classism talking. Does $200k/yr have more in common with $50k/yr or $1M/yr? What do your TV commercials tell you? Don't think about where the lines are drawn, think about who draws the lines.</p>
<p>Hess yells about a world of masculine power because she has the power to yell at it. But of course her power is limited only to yelling, she is impotent against a troll who yells at her. But her mistake is in thinking he has the power. No one has it, the system doesn't allow it. Even the mighty Economist demo feels impotent. Are they all delusional? This is the true critique of the system, not simply that one group reliably oppresses another; but that the entire system is based on creating a lack. This lack is not a bottomless hole that nothing could ever fill, but a tiny, strangely shaped divot in your soul into which nothing could ever fit: not money, not sex, not stuff, not relationships. Nothing "takes." Nothing counts. Nothing is ever right. Only novelty works, until it wears off.</p>
<p>This lack of power-- not power to rule the world, but existential power-- what is the purpose of my life? What is this all for? I get that I'm supposed to use my Visa a lot, but is that it? Shouldn't I be able to do more than this? Everything is possible, but nothing is attainable. Nothing tells them what is valuable; worse, everything assures them that nothing could be more valuable. That the media is the primary way the system teaches you how to want should have been obvious to Hess, she works for it, but for that same reason it was invisible to her.</p>
<p>You shouldn't be surprised that the only <em>sane</em> response to this impotence is neurosis, for which of course the system provides a psychiatric treatment that couldn't possibly work. "I need an Ambien, I can't sleep." But where did you hear that you <em>needed</em> to sleep?</p>
<p></p>
<p>VII.</p>
<p>If you're a guy, you probably don't realize the awesome pressure on women to let themselves get looked <em>at</em>: to reveal themselves online, to post a pic, to give everyone your attention, to stop what you're doing and give the other your self, even if they want to yell at you. "Hey lady, <em><strong>I</strong></em> hate you!" And yet that same pressure tells women they are valueless unless they are public. Madness.</p>
<p>The system is illogical, the things you want cannot actually coexist, but you dare not attack the system that promises everything, therefore something else must be blamed. As a basic example, Hess probably wants all the benefits of socialism and all the brand products of capitalism. When she can't have it, obviously the problem is misogyny.</p>
<p>Another example: Donald Sterling.</p>
<h6 style="text-align: center;"><img alt="donald-sterling.jpg" src="http://thelastpsychiatrist.com/images/donald-sterling.jpg" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" height="300" width="400" />everyone hates two of these: fat cats, america, virgins</h6>
<p></p>
<p>Here's a transcript of an illegal recording not done by the NSA that therefore everyone is ok with, consistent with our new standard of conduct: it is not illegal to make an illegal recording as long as it is given to the media and they profit from it and we can use it to rationalize our lives. Got it. Now I know you think you know what he said, but this time pay attention because he leaked a state secret:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can sleep with them, you can bring them in, you can do whatever you want. The little I ask you is not to promote it on [Instagram] and not to bring them to my games.... Don't put him [Magic Johnson] on an Instagram for the world to have to see so they have to call me... Yeah, it bothers me a lot that you want to broadcast that you're associating with black people. Do you have to?...You're supposed to be a delicate white or a delicate Latina girl.</p>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>Here's a question: who is THEY who have to call him? Why is a gazillionaire 3 years from God's judgment worried about They? And why would They care what his girlfriend does? The implication is that They are even more racist than he is, which should blow your mind when you consider They are about to pretend to try to take his team away from him and give him $600M.</p>
<p>But the other possibility-- which coexists with the first-- is that They don't exist, not in any coordinated way: They are you, the public, <em> far more dangerously racist than he is because his racism is overt and yours is disavowed</em>. What he is worried about is that you will see a picture of "a delicate white or Latina" girl next to a guy with large sneakers and... film your own conclusions.</p>
<p>Some clueless TV types have deduced that she set him up. Duh. Then they tried to figure out why he hooked up with such a manipulative harpy, and I therefore know with 100% certainty that to them having a hot young girlfriend is an unattainable fantasy. But <em>he</em> didn't have a choice: his superego required it, as a condition of his identity he is obligated to have a mistress, a <em>miss-stress</em>-- a girlfriend who is way more headache than any wife he was "bored" with. <em> Since everything is possible, he is obligated to enjoy</em>-- and if it isn't enjoyable there must be something preventing it, and that obstruction has to be her fault, or They's fault, what it can't be is his fault. He's 80, his sexuality is... on the decline. If he can't enjoy sex someone else has to enjoy it for him, in his place: no, not the black guy, but <em>her</em>-- she is doing the enjoying for him. Being cuckolded-- that's what this is, right?-- is fine, it works for him, as long as he isn't humiliated in public. "It's ok if They see me as a racist because I AM a racist, I accept it as part of my identity, there's no shame in it; but if They think I'm not satisfying her, or worse-- if they think I'm a cuckold-- if they don't see me the way I want to be seen----"</p>
<p>"If only you were the girl I thought you were!" he said, paraphrased. But of course she was the girl you thought she was-- she picked you. When you pick a woman for certain reasons, you are also picking the kind of woman who wants to be picked for those reasons. You may even have succeeded in tricking her that you like her for other reasons, but this is irrelevant: you like the kind of girl who likes the kind of guy who pretends to like women for other reasons....... But in any event, his desires were illogical, they can't actually coexist, so it must be They's fault.</p>
<p>It is heartwarming to think of the backlash against Sterling as a new intolerance of racism, and I'm told his case is important to society because he's famous and rich, but his money doesn't come with any power. So while you are all glowing in self-righteousness because you outed another racist rich guy, consider that you will never hear a recording of the head of Goldman Sachs making racist statements. "Maybe he's more progressive?" Hmm. Or maybe power won't allow it, power won't even allow you to think about it. The more likely explanation-- remember, basketball is a TV show on The Disney Channel the outcome of which couldn't be less relevant to humanity-- is that it is projection, it represents frantic activity as a defense against change. "I'm not a racist-- because THAT's a racist!"</p>

<h6 style="text-align: center;">no need to wait for the receipt</h6>]]>
        <![CDATA[<p></p>
<p><em>(I had reworked an old post for a psychiatry trade journal, which I would happily have <a target="_self" href="http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/blog/maintenance-certification-exam-fetish">linked you to</a>, except that page 2 is behind a login wall. So here is the version I submitted before the editors edited it, slightly longer with more typos. I am posting this because of the <a target="_self" href="http://www.aapsonline.org/index.php/article/aaps_takes_moc_to_court">new lawsuit</a> against the American Board of Medical Specialties.)</em></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The mission of the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology's Maintenance of Certification (MOC) Program is</p>
<blockquote>
<p>to advance the clinical practice of psychiatry and neurology by promoting the highest evidence-based guidelines and standards to ensure excellence in all areas of care and practice improvement.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's what the website says, I have no reason to believe they are not earnest. But far from succeeding, the program does the exact opposite. We have come to a moment of truth in psychiatry, and we are all going to fail. By which I mean pass.</p>
<p>We can start with the 200 question certification exam. The most obvious clue that there was something suspicious going on with the test was that there were no questions about Xanax. How do you measure "excellence in all areas of care and practice" without asking about the most commonly prescribed medication in America, let alone psychiatry? Meanwhile there were several questions about pimozide, a medication which appears to be prescribed exclusively by psychiatrists who want to brag about prescribing it. I was repeatedly assessed on my competence in Dialectical Behavioral Therapy, but was not asked to display my knowledge of SSI. You might retort that SSI isn't really psychiatry, but then why is so much of my time spent on it? The only thing I spend more time on is Xanax.</p>
<p>But though the missing Xanax was a clue, the insidious problem with the exam was not the content. To see the bad faith obscured by the questions, put aside the usual college freshman complaints of, "why do we need to know about pimozide?" and ask instead, "what happens if I get the question wrong? What happens if I get them all wrong?" The answer is nothing. There are no consequences for failing this test, at all. First, 99% of the applicants pass, I assume the other 1% forgot to bring two forms of ID. Second, even if you fail, you can take it again and again, as many times as you feel it's worth the $1500. Third: there were a thousand easy ways to cheat, here are three: I could have walked out of the building on an unsupervised "break"; I could have Godfathered an ipad to the back of a toilet; or I could just picked up the phone and called everyone. Who was going to stop me? There is more security at a pregnancy test, which made me wonder if how easy it was to cheat wasn't... on purpose. The retort is that doctors are expected to behave honorably, but the honorable ones were going to pass anyway. Those in danger of failing-- the very people the test should detect-- would be most tempted to cheat. Doesn't the ease of cheating render the test unreliable? If the test is unreliable and 99% pass, why have a test at all? Which reveals the gimmick: the point of the test isn't to measure competence, but to convey the impression that competence was measured. The point of the test is to say that a test was given-- <em>and nothing else</em>.</p>
<p>The question is, to whom are we saying this? It is as if psychiatry was in denial about its ordinary reality and was trying to create a different identity through the test itself. A psychiatry where there are right and wrong answers. Where pimozide and Dialectical Behavioral Therapy happens, a lot. Let me anticipate your retorts: that the questions are carefully constructed for their validity; that the test itself "incentivizes" learning; that not everyone prescribes Xanax; that if I'm such a smartypants, what system would I use? If these are your replies, you have missed my point: a flawed system isn't better than no system at all, it is worse than no system at all, because at least with no system we are forced to be accountable to ourselves for our education. "Not everyone will be so dedicated." Correct, but now those same undedicated people get an <em>official</em> blessing of their ignorance. Who doesn't walk out of even this ridiculously meaningless exam not feeling smart, accomplished, up to date? And who would dare, after passing, to criticize the exam that warmed his ego?</p>
<p>In addition to the test, the Board also requires a nauseating number of CME credits, but these CMEs are an even worse affront to learning. The only thing that CMEs guarantee is that money was spent on buying them, $80 and no questions asked is all it takes, which is even sillier than it sounds since I could go to a number of websites which offer instant and unlimited <em>free</em> CMEs, so long as I skip the long text and just take the post-test, which I can take as many times as I want. I can get 1 CME every 25-50 seconds, depending on my ability to click "b".</p>
<p>The retort is that the system is predicated on a certain level of honor, that physicians shouldn't cheat. Fair enough, but if you're trusting them to be honest in revealing what they learn, why not simply trust that they're going to learn it? Because the point isn't the education. The CME exists to say that there is CME; the CME exists to say there is oversight.</p>
<p>To clarify: the important criticism here is <em>not</em> that the multimillion dollar CME industry is a gigantic money making scam, something on the level of the 15th century sale of indulgences, because to say that would be actually to <em>defend</em> that very system: the money is a diversion, a patsy, what is corrupt about CME isn't the money but, as the default mechanism for continuing education, it subverts its own purpose. It reduces the interest in actual education so that it can pretend that it explicitly monitors it. If you have a minute to spend on your "education," the system pushes you towards CME. "Why not do both?" Why do both, who can do both? There are only 24 hours in a day. In other words, the system doesn't just fail, it forces failure.</p>
<p>Last year there was a large cheating scandal at Harvard, over a hundred students were accused of plagiarism in a government class, and amidst the usual self-aggrandizing criticisms of the college kids as entitled, lazy, or stupid, what no one wondered is why, in an introductory survey course predicated on institutionalized grade inflation and no wrong answers, did the students feel compelled to cheat when they were all going to get As anyway? The terrifying answer is that they weren't cheating to get the right answer, there was no right answer, they were forced to cheat to concoct the answer the professor wanted-- because that's the system. Meanwhile, while they were spending their time "cheating", what real learning could be done? None. So--- why bother with an exam at all? Why not just offer the course and give everyone an A anyway? Because the purpose of the test is to say a test was given, to prove to some hypothetically gullible entity that learning occurred-- and to prove it to ourselves. Which is why our reflex was to criticize the kids, not the system: we are products of that system, to criticize the reliability, let alone validity, of that system would be to open ourselves to scrutiny, to deprive us of a core part of our own identity. "Things were a lot more rigorous when I went to college." First of all, they weren't. Second, even if they were, why, when you got to be in charge, did you change the system to this?</p>
<p>Seen this way, these tests, whether Harvard government exams or MOC exams, are nothing more than fetishes: a substitute for something missing which saves us from confronting the full impact of its absence. In less abstract terms, these tests allow us to believe NOT that we learned something, NOT that we know something-- <em>but that there is something to know</em>. Since there is nothing new to learn, therefore there must be a test. The logic of a 10 year MOC exam is to keep us up to date, so it's fair to ask: what in psychiatry has changed in ten years, what are the major advances? Depakote was discovered to be the default maintenance mood stabilizer despite no evidence supporting this, but that fell into disuse at a time oddly coinciding with its patent expiration, which is suspicious but I'm no epidemiologist. Anyway, it wasn't on the test. Anything else? A few new medicines have come out, though none of them appeared on the test either. There's money to be made on the west coast using giant magnets, (fortunately) also not on the test. So? Was the ABPN worried I'd forget how to use MAOIs? I'm never going to use them, I have enough problems monitoring Xanax. The astonishing truth is that despite millions of dollars and hundreds of academic careers psychiatry has made no progress in almost 20 years, let alone ten, a claim no other medical specialty can make, and the truth which cannot be spoken out loud. Hence an exam.</p>
<p>Are you prepared to look inside yourself? When a nurse practitioner asks you what about your board exam is difficult, what will you say? Take a minute, it's important. "Well, it has neurology in it." Note carefully that the psychiatry questions aren't "harder," the appeal here isn't to a higher level of expertise in psychiatry, but an expertise in something else, something "more" than psychiatry, and it is this link that symbolizes our status as "experts." Older psychiatrists will be quick to assert that "clinical judgment" counts for a lot, and I don't disagree, but it's probably not testable, and it most certainly wasn't tested. So what does $1500 buy you? "Existential support." I hope it was worth it.</p>
<p>What makes the MOC not just a bad exam but evidence of a pathology is that though college kids have no idea what they're up against, that the system works against their education, psychiatry is the very discipline that articulated these defense mechanisms. It should know better, it is supposed to know better; which means that we are either unable to see what we are doing or believe that we are somehow exempt from this. But here we are, spending time and money on cosmetics and pageantry to pretend that we are learning, to pretend that we are being measured, all the while slinging random neurochemicals + Xanax based on an a suspect but billable logic in the hope that something sticks and no one notices. Frantic activity as a defense against impotence. There is a term for that, but you can bet your career it won't be on the test. <em>Pass</em>.</p>]]>

<h6 style="text-align: center;">what could it mean?</h6>]]>
        <![CDATA[<p>You just watched a historical TV moment: never before has the audience for a show been smarter than its writer.   I submit as second evidence the season finale for <em>The Bachelor</em> that was on yesterday, for three hours, drawing ten million "people".  Just remember that the next time some dummy from <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/television/2014/03/03/140303crte_television_nussbaum?currentPage=all">The New Yorker</a> complains that TV has a woman problem. </p>
<p>The Whitman's Sampler that was True Detective's finale is beyond discussion, literally, because what we now know is that no discussion was necessary.  All the references, all the philosophical subtext, all the weirdness-- turns out it was topping after topping, "does this make you watch?  How about this?"     Remember when the one character who turns out to be irrelevant says, "YOU'RE IN CARCOSA NOW," do you know what that meant?   Nothing.    The writer once read a story that had the word Carcosa in it but since his cat was already named Chuckles he used it in a TV script.  "It's a reference to--"  I know <em>what</em> it's a reference to.  <em>Why</em> is it a reference?  Does it mean anything?  Did "acolyte" or "metapsychotic"? </p>
<p>We see Errol shifting fluidly between several accents. Here is the show I thought I was watching: is this is a 1 Corinthians 14 "speaking in tongues"? Maybe coupled with the aluminum and ash reference it suggests Errol is Baal and Carcosa is Hell? </p>
<p>Here is the show I was <a href="http://www.hitfix.com/whats-alan-watching/season-finale-review-true-detective-form-and-void-im-not-even-supposed-to-be-here-today/2">actually watching</a>: though not mentioned ever in the show ever, he did that because the accident that caused his scars also made it hard for him to talk in his normal voice.</p>
<p>Meditate on that.</p>
<p>The writer googled Chekhov's Gun, laughed mightily and roared, "you're not the boss of me!"  I'm confused, so the killer's ears were green because he painted houses with his ears?  The point isn't that this explanation is stupid, the point is he didn't need to have green ears.</p>
<p>I don't care about "tying up loose ends" or sterile Judeo-Christian undercurrents, I have ABC for that.  I care only about internal consistency.  If you're going to make a show about, for example, zombies that is worth watching, at some point a character must say, "look, the only thing we know with 100% certainty is that every single one of us will eventually but unpredictably become a zombie, so we probably need to devote, oh, I don't know, 100% of our energy to dealing with that certainty."  Once you ask that question you are lead, for example, towards a sci-fi show about forced physical isolation where the only contact we have with each other is digital, but because of the lack of physical contact paranoia sets in, and suddenly every interaction becomes an implied Turing Test.  Would you watch that show?  Because without that question you have four seasons of Denial Lets Us Pretend The Old Rules Still Apply.</p>
<p>A show about applied philosophy in the form of a crime drama sounded intriguing. All of True Detective's existential despair, posed as, "how do you solve a series of murders when humans are a mistake anyway?"  -- well?  It's finally solved incoherently with an appeal to the Old Testament.  Oh, so God exists after all?  That would have been helpful to know up front, because I thought we were in Schopenhauer's "time is a flat circle" universe.  But whirlwinds are cool, too.</p>
<p>So through some kind of faith, Cohle loses both his nihilism and... his interest in pursuing child killers?  "We got ours."  Oh, we're done then.  Time for a sandwhich.</p>
<p>"I don't sleep, I just dream." Turns out that doesn't mean anything either, but if you're 16 feel free to lay it on the artsy girls.  You'll think they'll think you're mysterious.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>II.</p>
<p>I'm sure everyone has their own idea of how it should have ended.  But as an exercise how could you take the finale that was aired and fix it using only an additional 10 seconds?  You can't change anything else.</p>
<p>Could you have kept it true to the show's  original promise, such that "pessimist" Cohle is both redeemed AND still true to who he is?  Could you have rendered a closing scene so diabolically duplicitous that, on the one hand, most of the characters are saved/happy, while the world's bleak necessity of a tragic hero (since that's all he was, after all) becomes unescapable?  That we all live semi-peacefully only because of the sacrifice of a few loners in a garden, coming out one by one to allow their own crucifixion?</p>
<p>"Compassion is ethics."  Yes it is. How do you take Nietzsche's nihilism and make it compassionate?  Yet not sappy?  If you accept that the theme of the show is that life has absolutely no meaning and therefore it is up to you to give it meaning, how do you take the mess that is episode 8 and say that?</p>
<p>Could it be done in ten extra seconds? </p>
<p>At the end they optimistically talk about stars and daughters and life energies, and Marty smiles upon Cohle and Cohle smiles upon the universe, and Marty, having learned the true meaning of Christmas, skips off to go get the car.</p>
<p>Cohle sits alone in the wheelchair, watching him.   The emotion in his face disappears.  His face hardens.  He takes a long drag from the cigarette.</p>
<p>"But I lied for your salvation."</p>
<p>Cut to black.</p>
<p>Credits.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p><em>[Pastabagel and I have emailed about the show.  Some excerpts of his]</em>:</p>
<p></p>
<p>In Episode 3, the preacher says to Cohle, "Compassion is ethics, detective" when he departs the trailer leaving the reformed pedophile Burt in distress.  Cohle replies "Yes, it is."<br /><br />But if Time was created so things could become, and if acting out of the interest of others is compassion, then we should assume that Cohle is "becoming", changing into something else.  But what?<br /><br />Cohle asks in Ep. 5 "Why should I live on in history?"  It's an odd line, especially when in episode 1 he tells Marty that he "lacks the constitution for suicide."  But he also meditates on the cross (as an atheist),  "contemplates that moment in the garden, of allowing your own crucifixion."  But by 2012, Cohle has changed.  He's resigned himself to ending his own life, but only after settling this debt- doing what he owes.  One last act of compassion before giving up the only thing he has.  His life.  And once he's willing to do that, then he can do all the things in his life that require selflessness, courage, etc (i.e. things that require faith).  You have to accept the infinite so you can make the right moves in the finite.<br /><br />And when he does this, when he resigns himself not to his fate but to his eternity of endlessly repeating, at that moment he will actually have faith, because that's when he proves he believes in the eternal.  Only after doing this last good thing does he believe that he could stand the idea of an eternity of rerunning his life, because he knows at the end, he's fulfilled it.  "Nothing is fulfilled--until the end."<br /><br />According to Kierkegaard, this resignation to the eternal is crucial.  Kierkegaard was not an atheist but a diehard Christian.  He believed that when a man resigns himself to the eternal, to existing in eternity, and gives up everything that ties him to this world then he becomes a "knight of faith" capable of great Christian acts (like the self-sacrifice that is almost certainly coming in ep. 8).  When Kierkegaard wrote about a Knight of Faith, he contrasted the Knight of Faith to the mere Knight of Infinite, the "God botherer"--a phrase used twice in the show.  What did Kierkegaard say the Knight of Faith looked like?  Like this:<br /><br /></p>
<blockquote>Why, he looks like a <strong>tax-collector</strong>!" However, it is the man after all. I draw closer to him, watching his least movements to see whether there might not be visible a little heterogeneous fractional telegraphic message from the infinite, a glance, a look, a gesture, a note of sadness, a smile, which betrayed the infinite in its heterogeneity with the finite. No! I examine his figure from tip to toe to see if there might not be a cranny through which the infinite was peeping. No! He is <strong>solid through and through</strong>. His tread? It is vigorous, belonging entirely to finiteness; no smartly dressed townsman who walks out to Fresberg on a Sunday afternoon treads the ground more firmly, he belongs entirely to the world, no Philistine more so. One can discover nothing of that aloof and superior nature whereby one recognizes the knight of the infinite. He takes delight in everything, and whenever one sees him taking part in a particular pleasure, he does it with the persistence which is the mark of the earthly man whose soul is absorbed in such things. He tends to his work. So when one looks at him one might suppose that he was a clerk who had lost his soul in an intricate system of book-keeping, so precise is he.</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>[Here I said that the reference was clear, but that Cohle did not look like this at all, that he appeared much more like the knight of inifinite resignation, the "tragic hero."]</p>
<p><br /><br />The point is that the writer is taking the concept and running with it.  If we've already spotted Kierkegaard, Schopenhauer and Nietzsche, then we are firmly entrenched in the existential project, and we should expect to find references from other existentialists also.  And we do.  The preacher in 2002 tells us that God is dead ("only nearness is silence"). Ep 3 Marty asks Cohle the question from Dostoyevsky, "You know what people would do without God, it would be an orgy of murder and debauchery."  Would it?  Existentialists say no.  Do we have Sartre?  Why yes, we do.  There's angst and despair all over the place.  And the angst is brought on by the burden of freedom, not the absence of it.<br /><br />Think how often Cohle ruminations on suicide echo Camus's formulation of suicide as the fundamental question of philosophy in the Myth of Sisyphus (a guy endlessly pushing a rock up a hill, over and over, repetition, cyclical.)  But Camus answers it in the negative, faced with a meaningless world, you embrace the absurd and revolt, not commit suicide.  And isn't what they are doing now a revolt?  Kidnapping cops, burglarizing the houses of the most powerful figures in the state?  If this group has been kidnapping kids, if they held power for generations in the state, if they are plugged in all all levels, then isn't acting against them so deliberately a revolt against power?<br /><br />And if they are embracing revolt, if they are not embracing suicide (but are willing to make a sacrifice, is there a difference?) then they have embraced the absurd, and are on their way to the teleological moment ("Teleos de Lorca, Franciscan mystic"--a made-up guy that invokes Francis of Assisi a second time, reminds us of the teleological stakes, and re-invokes mysticism to bridge us from the ethical paradigm of the characters to the Continental philosophy started by Bataille (who was derogatorily called a mystic by Sartre, all in one shot, how is that for economy of storytelling, take that Cormac McCarthy)). <br /><br />Revolt: "Fuck this world," Cohle says. Remember how he says it?  Not in anger, almost off-handedly, like he's passing on the offer of a free lunch.  No anger, no big explosion.  Just...resignation. But he only gets around to trying to screw it 10 years after he says it.  And in 2012, it's jumper cable time.  No institutional rules.  And no masked perversion of the established rules.  (I'm a cop who's job is to uphold the law, and therefore I'm the one who can break it).  Rather than commit literal suicide, they commit it metaphorically, by giving up and saying goodbye to everything to take on the very institution that defined their identity.<br /><br />And if it is a revolt, then we invoke all the ideas of consistent with revolution?  Do we push out of the existential angst of the 50's into the revolution of the 60's and beyond?  The "present" in the show is 2012?  Will we get a postmodern postmortem, an aftermath 2 years later set in 2014? And by then, how much more of the landscape will be swallowed by Carcosa, the corrupting refinery towers that loom in the back of every scene in the show?</p>

        <![CDATA[<p><a href="http://thelastpsychiatrist.com/2014/01/randi_zuckerberg.html">Part 1 here</a></p>
<p>IV. <br /><br />Off topic: Randi strongly believes Facebook has a legitimate place in the business world, and this makes me think Facebook is finished.  I realize this is a speculative trade to make.  The usual anxiety about Facebook's future is that teenagers aren't interested in it, but the more relevant demo here is adult men, especially the ones in suits.  Facebook runs 60/40 women to men.  In the language of self-aggrandizing social media, that's a tipping point.  5% more estrogen and Facebook will be perceived as a women's site and no guy will want any part of it except for guys you will want no part of.  Hush yourself, you have your sexism backwards:  The instant a <i>woman</i> notices a man flipping through Facebook and one eyebrow goes up, you can head to your car and beat the stadium traffic, the game is as good as over.  That's what happened to Myspace.  It tipping pointed into "unemployed/some high school" and The Ruling Class had to sell it to Ima Holla Achoo for 20x less than they bought it.  Now it looks like Windows Mobile, which is demographically appropriate.</p>
<p><br /> Lose the men and you've lost Big Business, and at some size point a technology needs Big Business to want it, which makes Pinterest more valuable than Instagram and WhatsApp completely worthless.  This is the story of Blackberry.  The conventional wisdom is that people didn't like their emails in monochrome and preferred the sleek and sexy iphones, but you probably remember all the business casual salarymen proudly carrying around two phones like some bourgeois Frenchman with a dignified wife and a touch sensitive mistress, a couple years in a guy's going to get to thinking, "what am I, a Mormon, how did I end up with two wives?"   When Business was henpecked into supporting the iphone, Blackberry went sadly into menopause and defiantly into Africa.  Plausible deniability requires that I do not explain how layered a joke that is.  <br /><br />V.</p>
<p>I want to believe that Randi Zuckerberg is delusional, that because she is so wealthy and famous she sincerely believes if you take a MacBook Pro to a Panera and start a mommy blog or a particle accelerator, follow your passion, you should be a TEDx speaker in no time, but don't forget it's hard work, money isn't everything, and take time out to unplug!</p>
<p>But this person was at Davos.  Now I'm confused, was the invite Mark + 1?  That's the easy criticism to make, that she's famous only because of her brother, but nepotism only gets you so  far, Mark has a much more intelligent wife who just graduated medical school and no one is interested in her, and when the media has no other choice but to acknowledge her they do this:</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img alt="priscilla chan.JPG" src="http://thelastpsychiatrist.com/images/priscilla%20chan.JPG" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" height="547" width="500" /></p>
<p></p>
<p>I know, I know, it's probably photoshopped.  Still.</p>
<p>So on the one hand the media has no idea what to do with an Asian physician except depict her as a borderline psychopath on <em>Grey's Anatomy</em>, on the other hand they are excited to interview a lunatic  who broadcasts the appearance of excessive action-- frantic activity as a defense against impotence-- that's what the demo wants, and if you've been paying attention you will understand the translation: since the target demo has no idea what to learn from the experience of an Asian woman who despite marrying the Powerball became a physician <em>anyway</em>, you get Davos updates from a woman who plurals adjectives.  This isn't a criticism of her, it's a criticism of you: what do you expect to gain from all the haste, the energy, the "finding ways to be creative?"  Unlocking creativity is the third biggest swindle perpetrated by managment consultants, after open floor plans and managment consulting.  Creativity was never the problem, the problem was always the math. </p>
<p>Randi probably read her book herself and I don't doubt that it took months to come up with the phrase "dot complicated", after which she needed a vacation, but she doesn't understand why she wrote the words she did, what forces were acting on her, and what these forces wanted from her that she was elevated to celebrity status.  Consequently, her demo doesn't understand either: they think she's an idiot.  This woman went to the World Economic Forum, which you probably think is irrelevant and you'd be right, but grant that they are at least pretending they are relevant; yet they still allowed her in, knowing full well if anyone found out it could completely obliterate their legitimacy.  Why take such a gamble, to what possible benefit?  Look, if Scarlett Johansson is going then at least you can say Scarlett Johansson is coming, I <em>totally</em> get it, but putting Randi Zuckerberg on the brochure should be brand annihilation.  </p>
<p></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="charlize_theron.jpg" src="http://thelastpsychiatrist.com/images/charlize_theron.jpg" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" height="312" width="450" /></p>
<h6 style="text-align: center;">for the sake of this premise, pretend she came to the 2014 Davos</h6>
<p></p>
<p>"I'm pretty sure that's Charlize Theron, not Scarlett Johansson."  And I'm pretty sure they're the same person, and just because now she's Rachel Maddow doesn't mean she's serious.  "But she did actually do serious humanitarian work."  Yes, great, how about that.  Is there a blonder picture we can use for the flier?</p>
<p>It's probably very frustrating for whoever that woman is to try being anything other than whatever she is because no one will see her as anything but that, but this is the nature of the trade off: you spend your life trying to be seen as something, then if you happen to succeed then you will not want to be <em>only</em> that anymore, you are really something else.  But the world and/or your girlfriend won't listen.  This is especially hard if you simply age out of it, you want to move on with new ideas but the jerk in the supermarket wants you to be the person from '99, which means that the jerk in the supermarket still is the person from '99 and can't understand how calendars work.  "You changed!" he hisses with disgust because you fail to normalize his cortical sclerosis.  Sigh.  You can't punch him, there are witnesses.  There are always witnesses, and they will all be from '99.</p>
<p></p>
<p>VI.</p>
<p></p>
<p>You would be forgiven for thinking Randi was at Davos merely because she's rich, but consider that Warren Buffett was not there.  He's a capitalist, not a globalizer, so his brand doesn't synergize, in fact, he is the competition.   "No, he knows Davos is irrelevant!"  So why does he go on CNBC?  Buffett is a CNBC favorite, but what's so remarkable about his appearances is that while he is branded as a sober "buy and hold" investor, he is only ever asked about short term trends: are we at a bottom, what will the Fed do tomorrow, etc.  Why?  You know what he's going to say: "You want to buy good companies when they're undervalued," he'll intone over a cheeseburger, callously unaware that there are only 7 minutes until the close.  --What about Facebook?! Buy at 57?!   "Oh, I don't know anything about those new fangled tech stocks, I liked Wrigley's as a child, I understand the company, it offers durable competitive advantage."  --Oh, Uncle Warren, you're so out of touch!  (But the rest of <em>you</em> understand Facebook, you liked it as a child, doesn't it offer competitive advantage...?)</p>
<p>What does Watch Us With The Sound Down And Feel Like You're Active need him for?  It's not his words, it's him, he's the draw, he is the aspirational image of the demo of 35-54yo hopefuls: "Someday I'll be old, but when I am, I'll have become rich through the market."  So keep trading. </p>
<p>And here I have to go back over something.  The harder part of the psychology is that the demo doesn't want to become full time traders, either at home all day or on Wall Street-- that part must remain a fantasy--  because then it would be a job and it wouldn't count; it has to be a side gig, then their success wasn't their "work self" but their "real" self;  no one else can claim a sliver of that success-- not the liberals with their "'entrepreneurs' just pretend they don't benefit from public services!" or the wives with their "behind every good man...!" or the echoes of their father yelling,  "you need to apply to Sperry Rand, now there's a company you can put in forty years with!"  It all happened in their head, no one else can share the credit, it is 100% a consequence of their personal value.    Bonus: if they fail, it can be quickly discounted as merely a hobby-- that wasn't, after all, their real self.</p>
<p>The mistake is in thinking this has anything to do with the money.  It's said that most at home traders fail, but this is incorrect: they fail at making money, but they are successful at <em>feeling</em> <em>like a trader</em>.  <em>That</em> is the goal; the money is secondary, which is why they fail at making it.  The buy/hold/reinvest the dividends strategy of Buffet is totally opposite to what's desired, because the strategy does not involve market timing or status updates, it is on autopilot, and there's no "i" in autopilot.  Well, there's one, but it doesn't stand out. </p>
<p>The trading activity itself-- <em>the frantic activity</em>--  keeps the rest of reality away.  You're not your job-- you're something else.  You're not your family, you're more than that.  Things have the potential of possibly happening someday, and no work will have been necessary to accomplish it.  Just you wait.</p>
<p>But even that's not true.   The hardest part of the psychology is that feeling like a trader isn't the final goal.  Turn CNBC back on, there's Buffett, and oh, look, there's Peter Schiff.  Peter Schiff is another CNBC favorite, and his presence is even more incongruous until you understand it isn't.   Whatever your opinion of his opinions-- debt/inflation/government/armageddon-- his are more political than financial or macroeconomic rather than technical and anyway they are 100% long term opinions.  He may tell you to buy gold for the coming collapse, but you have a few years to open a position.  So why is he there?  "Because he's right!"  No-- why is he on <em>Fast Money</em>? </p>
<p>Here is the unspoken fantasy that explains the presence of Warren Buffett and Peter Schiff on CNBC:  "Someday I'll be old, but when I am, I'll have become rich through the market.  <em>And then people will want to interview me.</em>"</p>
<p></p>
<p>VII.</p>
<p>Swap out the demo, and this is Randi Zuckerberg.  She believes she is worth all her money, she believes she is more than Mark's sister, she believes she has valuable opinions.  Anyone who disagrees is a hater.  You're just jealous.  "No, she's a fool!"  Then how come she's so rich?</p>
<p>Those who are enraged by her are actually suffering from the same delusion she is, which is why her target demo as seen by Davos <em>includes</em> her haters.  The standard criticism of her is that she didn't really do anything to deserve her money-- "she got rich because of her brother"--  but this is a profound disavowal of the reality: she got rich because of timing-- even though her job at Facebook was trivial, she was there from the beginning and got paid in stock options.  What's interesting is that no one makes <em>this</em> criticism of her, because that's what her haters believe is supposed to happen to them.   She timed the market the way you're supposed to; what she did that makes her hatable, therefore, is that she had inside information.</p>
<p>I don't begrudge anyone the good fortune of right place/right time, take your money and run, but first drop a knee and be humbled before God reflecting soberly on the knowledge that you didn't deserve it.   I love getting paid, do whatever you can do to get paid, but do not let the money whisper to you that you are worth it, it will be lying and you will believe it.  You hold a fetish of value and not actual value.   But even her haters want the money to mean <em>retroactively</em> they were already deserving of it, this kind of fortune has bypassed reality testing and instead creates a new reality,  it uses the truth in order to lie: <em>of course</em> I'm not rich because of my work product, duh, you can't measure a human being's value based on his labor.  I'm rich because that's what I'm worth.  "Isn't that specious reasoning?"  Oh, dear, sweet, earnest, Lisa, I want to buy your rock.</p>
<p>And so the hatred of her, like all hate, is revealed to be a defense.  To her haters Randi is a buffoon, a step above relationship expert, she is too glaringly undeserving of that money; Randi is an obscene counterexample to the logic that the payout mirrors value and self worth.  She is a narcissistic injury for everyone else.  So she's disparaged in a specific way: she doesn't deserve all that money because she got it from her <em>brother</em>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>VIII.</p>
<p>Not coincidentally, this is the narrative of Davos to the demo that, unlike Randi, will never, ever, ever be rich; but to whom Randi represents a possibility of it:  with globalism comes the possibility of a lifestyle independent of your work product, and, more deeply, that your self-worth will finally be recognized by the world that is happy to pay you just for your individuality.  Why wouldn't it?  Your baby pictures are adorable.</p>
<p>To be clear, it's not a lifestyle that <em>could</em> be independent of your work product-- it has to <em>specifically</em> be independent of your work product, otherwise its based on something other than you and thus wouldn't count.  This is why <em>one</em> cannot profit from "nepotism" and "inside information".  Those are bad.  That they are, in fact, actually bad is besides the point: they are the exemptions which prove you are worth your money.</p>
<p>It's probably unnecessary to point out that this increase in lifestyle is built on the increased work product of whoever will do it for 30 cents an hour, and anyway it is a red herring.  The real attraction for us <em>isn't</em> just the lifestyle, but that it systematizes-- it makes normal-- not ever wondering: how come we have more lifestyle when we didn't do more work?  How did that happen?  In 2008 it was 1933 and six years later it's 1999, what kind of bananastown calendar is this? </p>
<p><img alt="sp500 2-28-14.jpg" src="http://thelastpsychiatrist.com/images/sp500%202-28-14.jpg" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" height="277" width="500" /></p>
<h6 style="text-align: center;">no caption is possible</h6>
<p></p>
<p>Confused, I run through my checklist: was there a war?  No.  Did they invent a new technology?  No.  Was cold fusion discovered?  No.  Did the aliens come?  Don't look at me like that, did they come?  Then nothing could possibly explain how we are all worth twice what we were worth in 2009, or even 30% more than we were worth in 2007.  "But stock prices aren't based on our worth."  Then what do they reflect?  Our productivity?  Our innovation?  A bet on our future prospects?  I ask you again: Did the aliens come? </p>
<p>And hence Globalism-- the brand, not the particulars-- is attractive because it is the physical manifestation of the logic of disavowal we already use for everything else.    "I don't know how it happened, but it makes sense.  After all, I am worth it."  Economics mirrors psychology, as it always must.</p>
<p>So Randi goes to Davos, never once asking why they would want her there?  Convincing her demo of underproducing hyperconsumers that capitalism-- controlling capital-- is pointless and mean, but globalism-- doublespoken as "progress", "human rights", "everything is connected"-- that is a noble cause.  Remember that the "culture" she thinks she speaks for, including those that hate her-- "the startup culture"-- is premised on starting a business in order to sell <em>the business</em> to someone else.   Of course the idea is to get rich-- which sounds like capitalism, if you're retarded, but observe the message that is being taught: that the necessary correlate to getting rich is to give all the capital to someone else.   <em>The power is traded for the fetish of power.</em>  That's not capitalism, it is madness, and apparently Davos and Randi think women especially will heart it.   It'll work for a handful of well publicized people pictured above the caption, "$100 billion!  You could be next!"-- followed immediately by a story about how worthless the business turned out to be, so <em>of course</em> the goal for you is to sell out ASAP;  but the vast majority who have aligned their psychology with this vector will pursue an impossible fantasy at the expense of their labor and their lives.  If you don't believe me, believe <a href="http://thelastpsychiatrist.com/2010/02/dont_settle_for_the_man_you_wa.html">Lori Gottlieb</a>.  This logic recommended to her to drop out of Stanford medical school to join Kibu.com, and now she's a relationship expert.  </p>
<p>"But capitalism exploits the worker."  I'll take my chances, because when you get a taste of the money but no access to the capital, you are easily seduced by Globalism-- the brand, not the particulars.  Hence the Hollywood stars, hence Buffett's grandson, hence Randi Zuckerberg, all who act like they belong there.  They do.</p>
<p>Every time you hear the word globalism, you should hear three things: 1. wealth uncoupled from work product.  2. Lifestyle as a reflection of your personal self-worth.  3. You give up control of the capital, and by capital I mean you.    "Do I still get paid?"  Sure, but you have to promise to spend more than what we pay.  "How will that work?"  Don't worry, Visa will explain it all to you.</p>
<p></p>
<p>IX.</p>
<p>It is no coincidence that social media, "everything is connected" (the default is plugged), is a vivid metaphor for globalism, even as so many social media vaginalists think they are against globalism if it is defined as Wall Street.   Propaganda doesn't care about your motivations, so long as you act in the required direction.</p>
<p>When social media is branded to men as a positive, the gimmick is that it magnifies their power,  e.g. "the hive mind."  This brand is reinforced even when it is depicted as bad, e.g. men's increased power to stalk, harass, or bully people.  On the other hand, when social media is branded to women with interests and passions but no math skills it's for "finding support" or "community"; nothing powerful is expected to occur there, it's a place to feel safe, "connect" and "have a conversation."  Those are not accidents, and they have nothing to do with biology, they are the result of market research and 50 years of very, very bad parenting.</p>

<div><br />This is a woman who hates everything.  I know that seems unbelievable given that she adorbs baby pics and is always shown smiling in lipstick three shades too bright for her hematocrit, but don't be fooled, her hate is transmogrified by money and fame and class buffers so it doesn't action the same way it does for Al Qaeda, but if she had a commercial pilot's license she would hit you with it.</div>
<div><br />Think seriously about what she (thinks she) wants:  <i>acceptance of her individuality</i>-- by<strong> work</strong>.  Not for her work <em>product-- there is none</em>; but for her individuality, by work. </div>
<div></div>
<div>First question: which work?  Not the job you have, it's real, and it's boring.  It is a future "career", the fantasy environment seen on TV dramas where all of life takes place.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Second question: why work?  Men are not being taught to want their job to value them, in fact, men want as little to do with their jobs as possible.  Randi and the globalism party bus are teaching women to want "careers"-- more precisely, to want to draw more of their identity from their careers.  The perk of taking your work home with you isn't more money, it's acceptance of your individuality.  Also you get to have to shop at Ann Taylor.  Before you seize on this as a biological flaw in women's character, let me remind you that they want work to accept their individuality because their family and relationships have failed them in this regard.  The only place they feel... happy?-- is when they are at work or plugged in.  "I know The Bachelor is mindless TV, but I just like it."  Keeps your husband out of the room, anyway.  How great is it to be alone?</div>
<div></div>
<div>Third question: what are the consequences of Randi's utopian fantasy of your job valuing you as an individual for<em> everyone else at work?</em></div>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>She believes her authentic self, via Facebook, should be accepted everywhere, home and work, so the suits should just shut their greed vacuums and embrace her baby pictures, her individuality-- after all, that's why they hired <i>her</i>, right? 
<div></div>
<div>That sounds laudable-- except that she's lying.  Ok, I have to pretend not to be sickened by her baby pictures, will she Like me live-posting My Summertime Threesomes?  Huh.  So now individuality has an asterisk: since Facebook should be on at work, everyone's Facebook should be nonthreatening, not mean, safe-- <i>work appropriate</i>. </div>
<div></div>
"Well, stupid, just don't put naked pics on Facebook."  Fair enough, but whereas before it was my poorly thought out choice, now it is not allowed by <em>work</em>.</div>
<div></div>
<div>"Well, Facebook shouldn't be on at work."  Duh, of course it won't be on at work, no company would allow Facebook to be on at work, there's work to be done.   So "ok at work" really means "if work saw it" and "Facebook" really means "the internet."</div>
<div></div>
<div>"Well don't put naked pics--" You're focused on the wrong side of the equation.  Why should I be careful of my internet behavior?  It's not because it can hurt me, it's because it can hurt the company.  What Randi doesn't realize she was used to say is that your internet life better be work acceptable since there's much more at stake there than at home. </div>
<div></div>
<div>If threesomes are't your thing, try a 2nd Amendment Fan Page or 10 Things I Hate About Senators and see if your job supports your individuality.  See how close to the edge you can get before Facebook itself censors you.  It is tempting to see this as a "war on men" because Randi tests as a genetic female, or a war on conservatives because Randi sounds like a "capitalism with a human face"-progressive who ran pass interference for the DNC in 2008, but I hope you can see that the force would equally oppose anything that was slightly outside of the mainstream.  Randi needs the job to tell her she is valuable, and the job wants frictionless employees.  The war isn't on men or women, it is on <em>individual</em> freedom, it is regression to the mean by suppressing the mean, where mean is defined by its deviation from SFW, according to W. </div>
<div></div>
<div>
<div>Since work has encroached on your home life <em>at your request</em>, since you've conflated plugged/unplugged with work/home, then</div>
<div></div>
<blockquote>
<div>"The time when your personal identity is a secret to your colleagues is over and done.  <em>And that's a good thing</em>."  </div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>It's good for the company, anyway.  You may be surprised to discover that the more replaceable you are to the company, the higher standards you are held to, that's what happens when you don't control the capital.  Rather than fostering individuality and creativity, Randi is telling the organ donors to sanitize their internet presence so that it doesn't affect the people who are profiting from your work.  Consolation is you get to post your baby pics and work <em>has</em> to accept it.</div>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>X.</div>
<div></div>
<div>In the absence of a big payday, the only things left that can value us are the job, and the media.   Regularly someone says something "offensive" in the media and the media punishes or fires him, and we debate whether that was justified or not.  The debate entirely avoids the most important point: the media company punished the guy <i>in media</i>.  They could have fired him privately, the way you would have gotten fired from your job if you started YZing all your coworkers.  Not only do they publicly fire him, they force the guy to make a public apology first-- and then fire him anyway.   Who benefits?   The offended victim?</div>
<div><br />But as much as we say we hate their power to judge us, we want them to have this power-- who else is going to have it?  If they have this much power to destroy a person, then how much more significant is a RT?  How great would it be if they acknowledged my worth?  With no power, what other chance do I have?  In the fantastical words of Marshall McLuhan, "there is no sweeter praise than the gaze of a tyrant, especially if it's in HD."  </div>
<div></div>
<div>This is what we want judging us, this is the calendar we're using.  Something external that can value us at 1999 levels while the real world is pricing us at 2008 levels.  My face is in my hands and I wonder how anyone could be asked to raise a girl in such a world?  Recently a female cardiologist with a "difficult" 10 year old daughter who had been well trained to want things but not control things asked me if I had read "the study in the New York Times"-- !?!?!?!?!?-- that said that people with the same surname, over generations, continued to achieve the same level of wealth, showing "<em>therefore"</em> that genetic factors were more important than the home environment in determining social mobility, isn't that probably true?  Having to do this sober I asked her, "But didn't you change your surname 11 years ago?  Or are you betting she can just upgrade hers?"  What else could I say?  If you read it, it's for you?</div>

        <![CDATA[<p><br /><br />Randi Zuckerberg is CEO of Zuckerberg Media, which, according to its 10-K, is an iphone.  If you have no idea who she is, and you shouldn't, then the answer to your one and only question is yes.<br /><br />In her considerable free time she wrote a book about social media. Here's a question: why does a woman who epitomizes the online world need to write a hardback book?  Could it be there's no money in the online unless you actually own the online? I'm guessing that wasn't in the book.  Ok.<br />   <br /><br /><img alt="randi zuckerberg bookstore.jpg" src="http://thelastpsychiatrist.com/images/randi%20zuckerberg%20bookstore.jpg" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" height="530" width="400" /><br /><br />I understand she gives a lot of interviews too, I'm sure they're TEDy optimistic and unactionable, but she's apparently an expert, shrug, here is her insight from six years of watching people work at Facebook: social media is a bad thing, unless it's used responsibly, then it's a good thing.  Settle in for nuance and shades of grey, all 50 of them.<br /><br />She thinks it's important to "find a balance" between plugged and unplugged life, a phrase you hear all over the plugged place but has suspiciously avoided scrutiny and is an example of media allowing you to debate the conclusions but forcing you to accept the form of the argument, in this case that a balance is what is desirable.  <br /><br /><br /></p>
<blockquote>I'm definitely not advocating a complete disconnect or complete unplug, that's not realistic... But what I am thinking is that people, we've reached this point where we feel like we just need to be always on. Always answering emails 24/7 connected, and the pendulum needs to swing back a little bit for us to reclaim a bit of our own time...</blockquote>
<p><br />Someone is lying, time to figure out why.  While she misdirected us with "pendulum" and "thinking" and "little bit" which are words vicious ideologues use to sound nonideological and "realistic", she substituted the plugged/unplugged balance with work/home balance, don't think I didn't see it.  Consequently, when someone/Randi tells you about the negatives of being too plugged in, they almost always blame work emails, as if the things that pay for your dinner are what distract you from dinner.   Really?   If I had to make a sexist yet 100% accurate prediction I'd say that it isn't hers but her husband's work emails that she can't stand at dinner, I'm pretty sure that no husband has ever gotten away with telling his still Anne Taylored wife to put her phone away, "the senior partner will just have to wait, we're about to say grace."   I'll cover myself by saying that, indeed, wives do sometimes answer work emails at dinner, however and importantly if this is occurring you can be sure the wife is extremely, extremely bored with everything that happens after 5pm, and this is compared to everything that happened before 5pm which was also *yawns*.  "Huh," she soundboards as she one thumbs a text to anyone else,  "Obama said that, you don't say, pandering to the flavor profile demo, what are you gonna do."   I'll be first to observe Obama has failed in every imaginable way, but Jesus, if that's your dinner conversation, just Jesus.  One of you should cheat just to force the eye contact.  <br /><br />Email is a convenient scapegoat not just because "family time should be protected" but because it gets us out of inquiring what went wrong with our home life that we could ever be tempted by work emails, and the avoidance of this inquiry is highly suspicious, i.e. on purpose.  "Honey," she says putting down her Trader Joe's summer salad, "I gotta take this."  Only in America does gotta substitute for wanna so we can avoid the guilt.  #behavioralgenetics.  You may recall industrialization/capitalism/Carousel of Progress's great promise of fewer working hours, and for the most part this has come true, please observe what we have done with our increased leisure time: filled it back up with work.  There was some consternation that evil capitalism had forced Target's employees to work all day on Thanksgiving, "no respect for tradition or family time!"  But how many of them wanted to be home on Thanksgiving?  The customers sure didn't, they were willing to camp out/throw down to get in a store what they coulda got easier/cheaper/faster from their Zuckerberg Medias.  "But the store itself has the responsibility to respect tradition!"  And only in America do we want the system to force us to do the right thing so we can take the credit.  #behavioraleconomics</p>
<div></div>
<div>One of our time's great sociological questions is why we filled downtime back up with work, and the reason is it's better than alcoholism.  At some point during the Truman Administration home life became more stressful than work life, where stressful is defined either as hysterical drama or rheumatismy boredom, and by Reagan II the home was no longer a respite from modern society's incessant demands to produce or at the very least a place to get a nap.  Home became work, it became a work, and not coincidentally this parallels precisely the history of homework.  ("But don't you think kids get too much homework nowadays?"   Sure, if you're doing it for them, you have become so myopic about your kids' possible trajectories that not only do you think faking their grades is their only hope, you think that will work.)  Neither is there home cooking at home, Trader Joe's does it cheesier and anyway it's on TV.  The XYs have long been resigned to this, hence their desire to "get an early start" or eat their lunch in their cars, while little girls were hooked on the potential of a fulfilling work and home life, or at least work or home life, now women are in on the reveal...  and it is shaking their very souls.   WTF.   If home is stressful for adults, think about how bad it is for teens, all they want to do is hang out and talk about how phony everything is and instead they're stuck upstairs with Snapchat while listening to their parents masturbate in separate rooms.  Better than listening to them divorce, I guess.  <br /><br />Part of the reason work and home keep mixing despite our professed desires is that that's how Americans were taught to see an aspirational adult life.  In every TV show and movie after <em>Leave It To Beaver</em> the gimmick has always been that the protagonist's job and personal life overlap-- doctors in love, CIA agents defending their family, late nights at the office trading zingers or abuse stories.  While we no longer think we want the overlap, the shows reinforced the false psychology that a person is something, all the time and everywhere, and the backdrop world "sees" it, accepts it.  This applies just as much to negative depictions of work/life overlap, e.g. the obsessed cop whose wife is now divorcing him because of the job: the point isn't that the overlap is "good", that's not the aspiration; the point is that the structure of these depictions represents the fundamental narcissistic fantasy: a fixed and clear identity-- a character-- <i>seen by a potential audience.</i>  This is why home is not relaxing: we are working to not let it be all that we are.<br /><br />Work, email, and Target's hours, expand to fill the time available, by request.  We took one look at the void and lack of interesting 5pm TV and started texting to anyone as fast as we could.  The truth is we're not overwhelmed by work emails, we just laid them on top to make it seem like we're buried in work.  Here's your #OWS update: work doesn't bleed over into home because capitalism is evil, work bleeds over to home because we have no idea what else to do at home, and thank God we can blame it on work.  "But capitalism reduces human relations to market relationships."  Oh my god, feed Bobby for a second, I have to totally tweet that.<br /><br />II.<br /><br />Together with work emails, the social media evangelists will lump in porn and gaming, because those are seen by the person in the doorway as "bad."  Their inclusion in the plugged/unplugged balance is to get you to accept the form of the argument--that there is a moral balance: work emails, porn, gaming= time away from human relations= bad; while things like Facebook and texting are "used responsibly can connect us all", these require a balance.  "Balance" means "not at dinner", though even this is nuanced, because while you shouldn't check your Instagram during dinner, it's perfectly acceptable to post to your Instagram during dinner, pretty sure that's what it's for.  Here's a foodie tip: the secret ingredient in every Instagramed delicacy is salt, and blowing the whites.<br /><br />The false dichotomy of "the balance" starts even earlier with reversing the direction of the vector of plugged/unplugged.   "You need to unplug" assumes the default is plugged, but the vast majority of our response to the blinking blue light is a volitional search for anything else but now.  It's worth recalling that the phrase, "you need to unplug" came from <i>The Matrix</i>, and the phrase was important because it had an ironic second meaning: not "you need to stop <i>drawing</i> from the Matrix" but "you need to stop <i>feeding</i> it at the expense of your life." <br /><br />"But the internet is soooooo distracting."  No, it's not.  A headline like, "<a href="http://jezebel.com/here-are-the-unretouched-images-from-lena-dunhams-vogu-1503336657">When It Comes To Pubes, You Have The Following Options"</a> feels like totallies but after ten thousand or so similar headlines, aren't you wise to the bait and switch?   I frequently get emails informing me that there are sexy singles available to chat right now, and I never click on them anymore.  On some site I saw a story to the effect, "You're not going to believe what a kitten and Miley Cyrus did at the AMAs!"  Not believe what?  That a Disney approved character-actor "won the internet" by pretending to sing a song written by the middle aged white guy who writes all of the 3:40s in front of a stage background of the hackest internet meme of all time-- and together they cried like girls?  "This. Is. Everything."  Yeah, I believe it. </div>
<div></div>

<div align="center"><img alt="dr luke.jpg" src="http://thelastpsychiatrist.com/images/dr%20luke.jpg" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" height="240" width="280" /><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">tell HarperCollins that women will like what you tell them to like, just get a boob to promote it</span></div>
<br /><br />Haters beware, clicking on a link because "I can't believe a stupid person actually wrote such a a stupid article about a stupid thing" is 100% the exact same mental process, and anyway, the system doesn't care about your motivations, so long as you act in the required direction.</div>
<div></div>
<div>"OMG, you're referencing something that happened like, three months ago?"  But it was the top story at the time-- so it wasn't that important?  You think you've forgotten about it because it's pop culture stuff, but this is wrong, you've forgotten about it because you are conditioned for novelty, so all topics become forgettable, which, in the logic of the system, is sort of the point of the technology.  "Come on, that's just a bunch of BS, of course we can distinguish between pop crap and things that matter."   Yes, but when the dopamine falls, you won't care.   #SandyHook  </div>
<div></div>
<div>"So because social media is mostly a waste of time, we should shut it off and be more present in our offline relationships?"  No, that's what the internet paid Randi to tell you so that the default=plugged.  This standard criticism of social media and texting is backwards: it doesn't detract from real life relationships, it represents a much desired break from them.   Having to <em>be</em> with someone, especially someone you're not having sex with, especially someone you're not having sex with anymore, is very, very hard; having people <em>see</em> you, especially when you're not amidst the symbols that you believe form your "real" identity-- say, a hedge fund trader who has to be home with the kids or a pretty girl in a sweats at a supermarket-- this is a kind of exposure far more embarassing than any selfie.  <em>What if they confuse that as the real you?</em>  You can see a version of this in married couples who talk to each other, joke, eat, raise kids, do couples stuff, but don't make eye contact.  Avoiding eye contact is a way of keeping reserved a part of yourself, to yourself. "I'm here," you whisper to yourself, "but I'm not going to let this all overtake me, I'm more than this."  This message is strictly internal, after all, you may not be looking at them but they can still see you.   Avoiding eye contact is avoiding a full on Sartre moment, the "scrutinous gaze" of the other.  "Umm, first of all, scrutinous isn't a word, second of all, Sartre called it 'the look'."  Um, hello?  My eyes are up here.</div>
<div></div>
<div>What the couple should have done to avoid this calamity is formed a shared identity, "this is us".  But how were they going to do this?  Everything conspires to drive them apart, hell, even a big tent TV show would be a shared hour but media loves multiple Nielsen boxes so just go buy yourself another flatscreen and watch your own targeted ads.  On the other hand, when TV ignores demography and tries to make a show for all audiences, you get <em>Laverne &amp; Shirley,</em>  and you get it for eight seasons, so I admit there's no easy solution.  "What about not watching TV?"  Hush your crazy mouth, telling America not to watch a Disney network is a non-starter, and for clarification ESPN= (0.5)Disney; the Princesses, Thors, ABC, the theme parks-- all that combined is merely the other half.  Now you know what's a stake.  The NFL's been handing out traumatic brain injuries for decades, but the moment Disney decided it needed the women that was the end of lockerroom hijinx.  But until it completes the NFL's rebranding as a kinder, bully-free, concussionless game, complete with engagement rings and <em>Us Weekly</em>'s "Ten Hunkiest White Or Articulate Quarterbacks", it's going to have to keep broadcasting <em>Nashville</em>.  Please don't make the mistake of assuming that the NFL wants female viewers, it couldn't care less, the ad dollars from beer and trans fats and cars are plenty.  What the NFL/Disney needs is to reduce the tension between females and males over all that's spent on it: merchandise, tickets, time, men would gladly watch all the commercials on Sundays if women didn't drag them to baby showers and home repairs.  Sports are male expenses that women reluctantly accept, but there's always a ceiling and if women were more into the experience then that ceiling could go up, way up.  The key is to rebrand the NFL not as a <em>man</em>'s game but as <em>America</em>'s game, thus reducing the barriers to consumption.</div>
<div></div>
<div>("You know, you could use an editor."  You could use some free association, it may help you see unconscious connections which drive your life.  "I find that weed helps."  Amateur.)</div>
<div></div>
<div>The only shared identity these couples pull off nowadays is "the kids", which is why they can make eye contact easily when they talk about them.  But relationship experts have analyzed today's marital difficulties completely backwards: rather than trying to find some common connection amidst the the turbulent waters of life, they are actually struggling <em>against the current of the relationship</em> to keep themselves private.  This is what they practiced for two or three decades, how can they unlearn the skills?  They fought so many years to be seen as individuals, "be true to yourself", a few years past the exploratory segment of the relationship and a shared mental space becomes suffocating.  So for them, plugging in gives them some privacy, a micro-break from shared reality, under the rhetorical cover of "connecting with others."</div>
<div></div>
<div>But why do we need "the balance?"  What does it replace, what went missing?  The very thing Holden Caufield hated: "phoniness", protocol and ritual for seemingly no purpose.  Politeness is fine, but why do I have to make small talk?  Why do I have to pretend to care about the weather?  Why, after a decade of marriage, should dinner be a regular review of the somewhat boring goings-ons of "the day"?  Because that formality is freeing, it allows self-conscious physical bodies to get used to standing next to each other without having to be <em>acting</em>, this includes husbands and wives.  When dinner is a controlled process with "manners" and expected topics of shared conversation and start and end times, as boring as it may get, <em>it</em> is boring, not you.  Women are especially sensitive to this absence of convention, this is one reason for the popularity of <em>Downton Abbey</em>, not to mention alcohol and iphones at dinner.  It is against this background of "phony" convention that teens can productively "rebel" and find their own individuality against a status quo; fighting against an emotionally illogical, arbitrary, unpredictable structure results in learning the opposite lesson, "whatever gets me through the day..."  Without this structure to social activities, when the "natural" conversation stops being interesting-- and it will, even if most of you weren't bad at it-- it would be a judgment about your relationship, about you.  And you'll beg St. Jobs to blink a path to safety because otherwise you have to sit there with no existential support.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Texting and social media's <em>slowness</em> gives them their power for this purpose.  You read a text, and it lingers, it keeps your attention because it's all there is; and then you respond with a piece of your real self, and wait for a response... what's happening is time travel-- while you are on pause, the rest of not-your life goes faster.  It is far more efficient at killing time than a phone call.</div>
<div></div>
<div><br />III.<br /><br />What no one will ever say out loud for fear of being labeled -ist is that "finding a balance" is something only women are encouraged to do.  For men it is supposed to be binary, on or off.  "Honey," the wife says without making eye contact, "please put your phone away."  --But it's the senior partner.  "He can wait, we're about to say grace." </div>
<div></div>
<div>Unlike men, women, as a group, are constantly being reminded by the media that social media is a <i>necessary</i> use of time-- just find a balance.  To be precise: it is not marketed as a diversion, or useful, or helpful or fun-- it's necessary to their existence.  The danger is branded as "excess."  And this coincides their role as the primary consumers and consumables, which is why Randi's stupendously uninsightful book is being heralded wherever online women congregate.   The book itself isn't meant to be read, it can't be read, it can only be hurled.  It is a MacGuffin; her interviews aren't promotions for the book, the book is an excuse for the interviews. No, of course she doesn't know this.  I'm sure she thinks she's talented and smart and fiercely independent (two fingers to the sky!), but getting her to televangelize about finding a balance (=the default is plugged) to her demo of underachieving credit card applicants is what suits the suits.   "How come Facebook's board has so few women?" ask the very women who would rather use it than run it.  Randi also wrote a children's picture book about a child who is obsessed with her ipad but "learns to unplug once in a while", tellingly even though Randi has a son she wrote the book about a girl-- a girl she <em>named after the internet</em>.  Get it?  Because she can't.  However, not all women are the target demo of Randi's lip synching, the CEO of General Dynamics is a woman, I think she has a higher security clearance than the entire Senate, and I know for a <i>fact</i> she builds alien spaceships, why not interview her about how she uses social media to promote her brand and make connections and break ceilings?  Because there's no Like button for hard work or triple integrals, which is doubly interesting because calculus was invented to make hard work easier.  "I just don't get math."  Can't do math if you weren't taught to think logically, and logic is tough on kids' self esteems and makes them way less submissive, easier just to put on a video.  "They're obsessed with the Wiggles."  And apple juice, whose fault is that?  So instead of "if you do the same amount of hard work as everyone else, you should end up in the exact same boat as everyone else, and it will sink because none of you know anything about boats," we get Randi Zuckerberg, a lot, who tells us about the occupational hazards of posting baby pictures:<br /><br />
<blockquote>First yawn? Adorbs. Facebook it. First hiccups? Obviously all my friends want to see that. Snoozing in a park? OMG, soooo cute! Who wouldn't want to see baby photos 50 times a day?<br /><br />
<p>I soon found out. I had some pretty honest co-workers, and one day one of them decided to give it to me straight. "Randi," she said, "Asher is adorable, but you can't keep posting a zillion baby photos. You have a professional reputation to uphold."</p>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>I just got the bends.  What the hell kind of profession could she have had that she's on Facebook all day and then the only criticism she gets is that her pics are of babies?  Observe that the discussants are both women.  Who does woman B believe will judge Randi harshly for her baby pictures?  Men?</p>
<p>All this worry about baby pictures vs professionalism exists in the minds of women, not men, which is why this was in HuffPo, using the atemporal logic of narcissism: if baby pictures can sabotage a woman's professional reputation, therefore she has a professional reputation.  Men are irrelevant to this discussion, a man would never bother to tell Randi anything because the minute a professional man sees a professional woman's baby pictures, she's moved from Bcc: to cc:.   A Cosmo-feminist will hashtag this as evidence of inherent sexism, but you may want to wait a few paragraphs before you hit RT.</p>
The easy "male" criticism is to say that too many baby pictures reveals her head isn't in the game, she's not focused on capitalism and destroying the competition so her boss can make more money.  "Wait, what?"   Don't overthink it, it's a magic trick, you're being permitted to debate the consequences because you've unknowingly accepted the form of the argument.<br /><br />It's not that babies are more interesting to women than men, it is that baby <i>pictures</i> are more interesting to women than men.  Men would rather look at a picture of a used condom than a baby, this is a scientific fact.  They get that the <i>baby</i> is precious to you, but there is nothing otherwise in a <i>picture</i> to connect to.  Furthermore, showing a baby picture to a man is an aggressive act because it demands a reaction, you showing him a picture of your baby is entirely for your benefit and not at all for his, it is a dare, in much the same way as a woman on a first date telling you she doesn't play games is a dare, a dare you shouldn't take, trust me on this, overpay the check in cash and run.  I'll grant that there is some level of bonding that occurs between women over baby pictures, worth exploring later, but not for men: men will only (and rarely) show photos of their children <i>doing</i> something, the <i>activity</i> is what represents the kid as kid and them as a parent.  Showing a man a baby picture is equivalent to showing a woman a picture of his car.  "A #baby is more important than a car, dontcha think?"  Yes, but a picture of a baby isn't more important than a picture of a car.  "Yeah, but--"  I know.  Logic is mean.  <br /><br />In the world where the media postulates social media as an absolute requirement of the modern era-- the era where everything is fetishized-- no one is permitted to make the distinction between a value and the picture of a value, they are made equivalent, so daring to criticize Randi's baby pictures is made to sound like misogyny or misobaby.  It's not. I love food but if you ask me to look at a picture of a food I will poison your toothpaste.  Be careful: the point is not that a woman <em>shouldn't</em> post her baby pictures, the point is that the system cannot profit from her baby except as a photo, so that <em>in order</em> to get them to do it more-- to be online more-- the system <em>teaches</em> them to overvalue the photo; and this must necessarily be at the expense of the object itself.  #porn.</div>
<div></div>
<div>And here again you glimpse the long con: a power struggle packaged as a gender war.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Usually you imagine "sexism" as a pervasive institutional power directed top down against you, oppressing you with sexist jokes or heels at work, but it's much more illuminating to understand sexism as just another tool to increase consumption.  An obvious example:  it costs women more to dress professionally, even though they get paid less.  But sexism can be run in the reverse, too, for women's "benefit."   Example: We say things like "the public has a ravenous hunger for celebrity photos," but this is demonstrably untrue, paparazzi pics are almost entirely a product for the female demo, no man wants to see a picture of any of the Kates or their babies or their homes.  However you will never hear this said out loud <em>in the media</em>, they will tell you (and you will parrot) that the greedy force that creates the paparazzi is "America" or "the public's obsession with celebrity"-- men are lumped in with women.  Men's relationship to celebrity  after teenage years is completely different, the pictures matter much less than "information"-- a pic of Lebron is worth way less than his stats.  But the easy money is in digital photos, monetizing envy has very low fixed costs and great margins, and nothing can be permitted to threaten the money, so when Princess Di is driven off the road we blame the paparazzi; but then, in a surprising admission of guilt, the media comes out and accepts some responsibility-- although in a very specific way: "the media has succumbed to the ravenous demands of the <em>public</em>'s infatuation with glamour and wealth."  Because if everyone-- not just women, but everyone-- wants this, then women have less guilt about wanting it and men get the sense nothing can really be done to change it.   Do you understand the infrastructure that is necessary to cause people to disavow something that they know with total clarity, just to keep the money flowing?   The moment male America decides out loud that we're harassing actors and actresses not for "our" prurient interest but for women's prurient interest only, to the media's financial benefit, they will require an open carry permit for telephoto lenses; tell them gays also like <em>Us Weekly</em> and they will repeal the First Amendment.  Believe it.  The system repackages a female product as a "public" product to get it past the hairy misogynists who hate women's media because it doesn't wisely use a ball, and if a couple of celebrities have to be harassed or die for their ballless entertainment, whatevs, there's no reasonable right to privacy on the street or on a beach.   The consumers are women, the rest of you pad the numbers.  "It's hard for me to tell what side you're on here." Sides: the form of the argument you've been trained to accept.   Still not convinced?   Swap out "America's celebrity culture" with "America's gun culture" and "male America" with "Senator" and see which Amendment gets repealed.  "Now I'm totally confused what side you're on."  Jesus.  Just Jesus.</div>
<div></div>
<div>It's right about here that I should again remind everyone that for five decades we've been repeatedly assured that men are visual creatures.   Time to rewrite the evo psych texts to support the new economy.<br /><br /></div>

        <![CDATA[<br /><br /><br /><br />Number of people killed: 15<br />Number of people Katniss kills: 1<br />Number of times she is saved by someone else: 6<br />Number of times she saves someone else: 0<br /><br />But boy oh boy, wasn't she spectacular at practice, 9 targets in 30 seconds, and then she strings up a mannequin. Take a bow. &nbsp; Badass.<br /><br />I.<br /><br /><br />For context, here is why THG is a <a href="http://thelastpsychiatrist.com/2012/04/whats_wrong_with_the_hunger_ga_1.html">sexist fairy tale</a>.&nbsp; It anticipates most of the criticisms.<br /><br />Except one.&nbsp; An insightful, even optimistic retort is that <i>at least</i> she's not killing, at least she's made the ethical choice to not kill anyone.<br /><br />But this insight is exactly what you are supposed to think, it is an illusion, and it is why my tally above is also a lie.&nbsp; She kills one person, <i>but she is responsible for all of their deaths</i>.&nbsp; From the very beginning of the Game it was immediately true that everyone but one got killed.&nbsp; From the very beginning, before anyone dies, you are guilty of&nbsp; everyone's death.<br /><br />That's the Game.&nbsp; It's not like they went in there thinking, "I'm not going to kill anyone because I am planning to escape this Game." No one backed up their pacifism with suicide.&nbsp;&nbsp; Katniss's thinking is basically, "I'm not butcher, but I am going to try and survive." &nbsp;&nbsp; The movie elevates her passivity into a moral act, which it isn't, that's the trick.&nbsp; This is a closed system.&nbsp; Whether she shoots them down herself or waits for the psychopath in the group to do it for her, it's the same.&nbsp; <br /><br />What's important is that this "choice" not to kill, and the personal feeling of morality it (falsely) gives you is how the system survives.&nbsp; Because you feel good about your choice, "at least I'm a good person," you fight the system much less.&nbsp; You are less of a threat to the system because you are allowed to believe you're a good person and they're not.&nbsp; But you're not.&nbsp; You killed 15 people.&nbsp; I counted them.<br /><br />The true criticism of the movie isn't that it is too violent, but that it is not violent enough-- it is Disney violence, and whenever you see the word Disney you should instead see "100% in the service of the existing social structure."&nbsp; The movie presents "not murdering anyone" as if it were a moral option, as if it were true; so that you are not revolted by the fact that you did kill 15 people; so that you do not fight to change the system that forces you to kill 15 people.<br /><br />Just because the system tells you, "the other tributes are your enemy," 
doesn't mean it's a factual statement, you have to answer the Thin Red Line question: "who's doing this? Who's killing us?"&nbsp; <br /><br />The Game is rigged to prevent all choice but allow the illusion of choice. There are Good Samaritan laws in place which protect you from liability if you give someone CPR in good faith but inadvertently crack a rib.&nbsp; But this is nonsense.&nbsp; The person motivated to offer CPR NEVER thinks about a future lawsuit, he just acts; or, in the reverse, the person who is nervous about lawsuits was never going to help anyway, and thank goodness he can blame it on lawyers.&nbsp; These laws have the perverse effect of allowing the us passive aggressive techonauts to observe events rather than intervene in events.&nbsp; "Come on, what am I going to do, you know the litigious world we live in, besides, we have paramedics for that."&nbsp; So you're telling me that, i.e. for example, my child got hit by a car on the street and instead of Airway-Breathing-Circulation your plan was to shift to Landscape mode?&nbsp; "Well..." You better burn off your fingerprints and move to Siberia. <br /><br />There's going to be some who will respond with the obvious: "yes, but the fact is, not killing is better than killing-- or do you think putting a gun to someone's head is really the exact same as not doing that?"&nbsp; And some will counter-retort that it's like war, if you send soldiers to fight you are responsible for their killings.&nbsp;&nbsp; Both arguments miss the point completely: NOT killing is better FOR HER, because then SHE doesn't have to feel any guilt.&nbsp; But everyone dies ANYWAY.&nbsp; Not killing is entirely a selfish act, not a moral one, if my kid gets hit by a bus the driver at least did it by accident, you CHOSE to not help, you are WORSE, see also Steubenville.&nbsp; "But they did the rape!"&nbsp; But they did it for you to <i>see</i>, do you not get it?<br /><br />It looks like Katniss is free to make personal decisions, but no matter what her free brain decides, everyone around her dies as planned, huh, that's odd.&nbsp; The only "free" choice, the only way to beat the Game, is not to play.&nbsp; If you really wanted to be a moral agent in such a terrible environment, you'd have to convince the other tributes to all agree not to fight each other, knowing full well that the soldiers will therefore come-- that is the point of the maneuver, to expose the evil of the system instead of allowing them their deniability, "oh, we don't kill anyone, the kids kill each other!"&nbsp; You have to sit there and Prisoner's Dilemna the hell out of this and hope none of the other tributes breaks ranks and opens fire.&nbsp; It is the only anti-system choice short of revolution.<br /><br />The response that this maneuver puts the individual Districts in danger, too, is, unfortunately, part of the deal. The genius of the system is 
that it never puts everyone at risk, it presents them with a lie: <i>only </i>these Tributes are at risk. If the Districts themselves don't want blowback, "we don't want trouble", if they "want" to maintain the status quo, they have to send people <i>to</i> participate.&nbsp; You don't send a Theseus, you send a Katniss, which they did, hence another round of Hunger Games.&nbsp; She'll look heroic, she'll perform badassly, and nothing will change, which it didn't, which is why even though she won the first movie there was a second movie. &nbsp; <br /><br />There's going to be some of you who will be confused, "are you saying Suzanne Collins planned this?&nbsp; No way!&nbsp; You've totally misinterpreted--"&nbsp; No, no.&nbsp; Collins wrote the story, yet she is not aware herself of what she wrote; she couldn't have written the story any other way than from a narcissistic perspective because that's all she knows living in this world; or, to reverse it, had she known, had she written a different kind of story with a different kind of hero, it would never have been published, let alone made into movies, we'd be on Twilight 7.<br /><br />It's here that I should SPOIL that the revolutionaries who do finally fight the system DON'T EVEN TELL HER ABOUT IT.&nbsp;&nbsp; Everyone around her is extraordinarily heroic and self-sacrificing, they literally drag her bad ass to the finish line at the cost of their own lives, so that she can survive as a symbol, and the rest of you dummies think <i>she </i>is the hero.&nbsp; Only a <i>taught </i>narcissistic psychology would SEE her as heroic when right in front of you and your eyeballs you can observe she is the least heroic of all.&nbsp; I'm not blaming you, this is the training we all got.&nbsp; The sleight of hand of such movies is that it presents an entirely different society (full totalitarianism) in the context of TODAY, in the context of narcissism as expected, as ok, so meaningless acts become exciting and meaningful acts are obscured. Huh, Mags blew herself up with poisoned gas.&nbsp; Ah well, she was old.<br /><br />But in totalitarianism, there are no individual acts-- that's the whole point of the totalitarian structure, that's what it wants, what it wants you to become. Your acts appear personal and individualized but conform beautifully, they are no threat.&nbsp; It would NEVER occur to a real Hunger Games hero to <i>show off</i> for upper management, <i>which is why no one else did it</i>, that would be a meaningless act, only we today would applaud this, which we did, loudly.&nbsp; Badass.&nbsp; Not to go ancient history on you, but Achilles was the equivalent of a comic book superhero to young boys for two thousand years, it would never have occurred to any of them to applaud him for his trick shots.&nbsp; It wouldn't have made sense. It doesn't make sense.&nbsp; It is madness.<br /><br />There are some earnest attempts to apply Game Theory to the Hunger Games, what is the optimal solution?&nbsp; But unfortunately the people who do this are bad at math.&nbsp; Let me try to explain.&nbsp; If 2 tributes are to be randomly selected from a District of, say, 1000 people, then the probability of you being killed is...... 100%.&nbsp; You can double check me if you want, but the math is correct.&nbsp; And-- and this is the point-- the math becomes correct if and only if you think it isn't.<br /><br /><br /><br />]]>

<div align="center"><font style="font-size: 0.8em;">is Obama there?</font><br /></div>]]>
        <![CDATA[<br /><br /><br /><br />Everyone knows ads are propaganda, but what happens
 when you have an ad <i>for</i> propaganda?&nbsp; While
 you sip your first Guinness and try to figure out why China's 
government can only ever shut down once, you can ponder this ad:<br /><br /><br /><br /><img alt="ajam time ad cropped.jpg" src="http://thelastpsychiatrist.com/images/ajam%20time%20ad%20cropped.jpg" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" height="483" width="400" /><br /><br /><br />The
 only reason you haven't spit nitrogen bubbles on your screen is I haven't shown you the other half of this outstandingly accurate abomination.&nbsp; You 
should get yourself a towel and another drink.<br /><br />I.<br /><br />Intelligent people
 like to tell each other that they aren't liberal or conservative but 
independent; that Fox and MSNBC are biased and can't be trusted, 
that partisanship, "special interests" and "lobbyists" have destroyed 
America; in essence, that they are not ideologues but practical, 
reasonable people who just want the system to do what's right.&nbsp; Then you
 ask them what exactly "right" is, and the yelling starts.<br /><br />Intelligent
 people, like racists, are fluent in describing themselves in opposition to what they&nbsp; are not, but ask them to define themselves by what they are, tell you 
what they do believe in, and they're lost.&nbsp; They have opinions on 
issues, sure, but ask for an overarching ideology and their face botoxes.&nbsp;
 Overarching ideology?&nbsp; Only people with manifestos have ideologies, not
 having an ideology is the whole point of being independent, the only 
thing they deal in is "facts" or "reality", and gun to head if they 
believe in anything it's "science."&nbsp; Not physics or chemistry, but 
evolution.&nbsp; You know, whatever ideologues hate.<br /><br />I phrase it this way not to insult a group, but to show you how very easy it is to <i>brand identify </i>a
 group, because when a group becomes a demo it loses most of its freedom
 of action and becomes baa baa black sheep.&nbsp; Do you want to see the 
consequence?&nbsp; Turn on CNN.<br /><br />II.<br /><br />"The government shut down 
just shows that our government doesn't function correctly!"&nbsp; That's one 
interpretation, the other is that when a car starts to smoke, you pull 
over and fix it, you don't keep going till it explodes, though I 
recognize the explosion makes for better TV.&nbsp; What you're seeing is the 
ordinary back room realigning of interests and powers, but this time trying desperately to hide
 from a voyeuristic media that caters to a demographic, i.e. you, that 
believes that never more than three at a time colorful but poorly 
understood #issues will eventually get us to Mars.&nbsp; "We shouldn't go to 
Mars."&nbsp; You got your wish.&nbsp; Off 
topic, speaking of Mars, here's an interesting thought: if things 
proceed as per y=mx+b, then the entire human race of the future 
interstellar diaspora will
 all be Chinese.&nbsp;&nbsp; Huh.&nbsp; What do you know, Star Trek was way off.<br /><br />Americans,
 by which I mean a populace propagandized to the Left or Right or Middle, 
cynically believe that "wanting to get re-elected" or arrogance or
 ideology is what's to blame, as if 500+ career Machiavellians are too 
stupid to know what an underemployed theater grad knows.&nbsp; "They should just do the 
right thing!"&nbsp; Who will let them?&nbsp; You?<br /><br />The shut down was the inevitable consequence of a government <i>not permitted to compromise</i>,
 smothered by the oppressive gaze of a kamikaze media that will kill 
itself and your country just to get a headline today.&nbsp;  I'm starting to wonder if the reason it is always pretty white 
girls who get kidnapped is that the media is the one kidnapping them.&nbsp; And you blamed Bear Stearns for being too focused on short term profits?&nbsp; CNN's time horizon
 is your next micturition.&nbsp;&nbsp; The media demands partisanship, 
conflict, opposing sides, but despite having 24 hours to fill will never, ever explain the interplay between complex issues, preferring to feature them in segments while hyping them to a crisis.&nbsp;&nbsp; Imagine trying to have sex 
always on camera, and always with a goat, and always with some know-it-all screaming at you, 
"get hard now!&nbsp; NOW!&nbsp; 8 seconds left!&nbsp; NOW!&nbsp; What's wrong with you?!"&nbsp; Jesus, can I take a minute and do this privately?&nbsp; "Transparency!"<br /><br />If
 Senator X "makes a concession" the relevant media will proclaim him a 
loser and a coward, they don't want representatives, they want cage fighters.&nbsp; There's no reward for compromise and there's no safe place 
to attempt it, either.&nbsp; This is 100% your fault, "I can't believe how stupid these people are!"&nbsp; It's great how you 
can't find employment but have time to micromanage the U.S. Senate. 
#outrage<br /><br />If you want to know what political career disaster looks like, 
have an infinitely leggy ex-sorority girl in flesh toned Manolos 
sitting behind a glass table in perfect lighting announce to 50% of America that you were beat by an old woman from
 California or an old man from Ohio.&nbsp; "Ha ha, what a cuckold!&nbsp; Back to you, Kent." &nbsp; You
 blame Congress?&nbsp;&nbsp; They are the ones who 
"don't get it"?&nbsp; When a representative democracy gets crippled by what 
amounts to a 3x3 magic square, it's not that they can't figure out the 
solution, the solution is easy, the answer is 15 and the five is a 
gimme, we just need someone to dare allow himself to be filmed putting the 1 
on the left or the right or the center so we can finish the other 13 
numbers and go bomb Syria.&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait, what?&nbsp; I don't understand."&nbsp; Yes, 
that's my point exactly.<br /><br /><br />III.<br /><br />I'm not saying the shutdown isn't a real problem, only that if the news came out only in weekly format, this particular shutdown wouldn't have happened.&nbsp; Or, said differently, if there was a government shut down at a time when the news came out only weekly, it would mean we were getting a new flag.<br /><br />All of what is now being subverted by the media has been detailed in <i>The Process Of Government</i>, you should read it.&nbsp; But you won't, it has too many characters, and this is accurate no matter how you define characters.&nbsp; Come on, at least read Chapter XX, it's online.&nbsp; Jesus, <a href="http://www.archive.org/stream/processofgovernm00bentuoft#page/446/mode/2up">here</a>.&nbsp;
 "Umm, It's pretty boring."&nbsp; I know, I know,&nbsp; you want to know how the 
news relates to you, and boy oh boy do I have the news network for you.<br /><br />"But that book was written in 1908.&nbsp; Based on what I've seen on <i>Downton Abbey</i>, things were a lot different then."<br /><br />Well,
 yes, obviously, there had just been a massive leap forward 
in technology and industrialization, a booming economy fueling a wealth 
gap, temporarily course corrected by a financial panic "precipitated" by 
the failure of two overspeculating brokerage houses.&nbsp; There were also, 
simultaneously, great advances in progressive causes like worker's rights 
and food quality, all on the background of decreasing importance of 
religion among educated whites in favor of science. Not physics or chemistry, but evolution.&nbsp; Tabloids were 
incomprehensibly popular,&nbsp; partisan media the norm. A loosening of conventional morality manifested as bored 
promiscuity, female bisexuality, and a flood of new porn the likes of 
which never existed before.&nbsp; <br /><br />"That does sound different.&nbsp; And 
awesome.&nbsp; What did their Millennial kids inherit, what did they 
experience over their adult lives, say 1929-1945?"<br /><br />I totally don't know, <i>Boardwalk Empire</i> only goes up to 1924 and <i>Mad Men</i> starts 1960.<br /><br /><br />IV.<br /><br />The problem with blaming the shutdown on Congressional partisans is that the partisans on either side know exactly what they want.&nbsp; When there are specific things you want, compromise is usually possible. <br /><br />The public in the middle, however, don't understand politics, only emotions given to them by TV, and so their beliefs are cobbled together in real time, improvised, as they get "more information."&nbsp; One trending topic at a time, each vacuum sealed to prevent cross contamination.&nbsp; They don't look at things historically, culturally, humanistically, or even selfishly, there exists no system for interpreting "the facts."&nbsp; Compromise becomes impossible, as a simple example, when a "moderate" "thinks" there should be more restrictions on guns, they want gun owners to give up something they want very much-- <i>in exchange for nothing</i>.&nbsp; "But it's the right thing to do!"&nbsp; And the yelling starts, in HD.<br /><br />Worse, they proudly announce their lack of ideology by branding themselves as Independents-- capital I, a thing, a demo.&nbsp; He willingly lessens his independence to become part of a group.<br /><br />The
 "independent" demo actually has all the textbook characteristics of a 
group most susceptible to propaganda, more correctly "pre-propaganda", and by
 textbook I mean literally <i>Propaganda</i>.&nbsp; <br /><br />They consider 
themselves leaderless.&nbsp; They can have representatives, they can have 
"evangelists" but they have to believe that their conclusions are all 
their own, through individual reflection and objective consideration.&nbsp; 
Interestingly, and on purpose, they believe their brains can handle such an 
analysis, any analysis.  This isn't arrogance.&nbsp; They are told, by universities and the 
media,
 that their mind is prepared to do this heavy lifting as long as they 
are given just the <i>right</i> facts, filtered from the "noise."&nbsp; <i>"Where can we get the right facts, in a world of liars?</i>"&nbsp; Good question, maybe the news?<br /><br />Commonly, independents have a single personal issue, say gun rights or abortion, but no personal experience with other issues, and 
lacking any subjective starting point, they therefore believe that ONLY 
objectivity will give them the truth. The less life experience they have 
the better; the less they've seen of the world, the fewer people they've 
argued with (in person, where it is real and has real consequences like punches), the less frequently their water balloon 
worldview is tested by people with pins, the more they will cling to the
 premise that "facts" are what's important.&nbsp; In this way the one personal issue serves as a reference point which the propaganda exploits: "hey, gun advocates, did you know you like low corporate taxes?"&nbsp; I do?&nbsp; "Yes, because the people you hate are for raising them."&nbsp; Consequently, raising corporate taxes is felt like an attack on the Second Amendment. "Liberals!&nbsp; Taking away our rights!"<br /><br />But sometimes the complexity of issues is just overwhelming, once in a while reality creeps in, and issues are discovered to be massively complicated, and anyway he has no power to do anything.<br /><br />No doubt this sounds depressing, he's going to 
start drinking heavily, or become a cynic, or go the Hemingway.&nbsp; So the 
media=propaganda fosters his regression towards a much desired solution: total alienation.&nbsp; The media explains how things relate to him, and as long as he understands 
what's going on, he feels empowered.&nbsp; He is given an ideology without even knowing it.&nbsp; Now he doesn't actually have to do anything, indeed, it's 
way the hell better if he does nothing.&nbsp; All that's required is support,
 and through his support not only will "the right things" happen but 
he'll share in the credit.<br /><br />You'll counter that there are right leaning and left leaning independents, isn't there a difference? but this misses the point: propaganda doesn't try to get you to believe something, but to <i>do</i> something, and in this case it is to do <i>nothing</i>-- it doesn't matter what you choose to believe, as long as your outrage is done from inside your house.<br /><br />This is the whole gimmick of media, not polar but triangular, right, left, middle, 
mobilizing an army of assonauts to feel strongly enough about something 
that they don't do anything. <br /><br />I already knew that 
"independent" was a group looking for representation, what I was 
surprised by is how fast "independent" became a <i>mainstream </i>brand demo.&nbsp; 
Here is page 2, and 3, of <i>Time Magazine</i>:<br /><br /><br /><img alt="aljazeera time1.jpg" src="http://thelastpsychiatrist.com/images/aljazeera%20time1.jpg" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" height="314" width="500" /><br /><br />The first and most immediate observation is that Al Jazeera assumes its American target demo is stupid, very stupid, because here we have what is most certainly a college graduate&nbsp; who considers herself in need of unbiased, objective, independent news-- <i>yet she is still reading Time Magazine</i>, as her main source of <i>in depth</i>
 news.&nbsp; Rana Foroohar balanced by Fareed Zakaria,&nbsp; two wrongs can make a
 right, and "it's somewhere in the middle."&nbsp; She has decided that the 
problem with her understanding of the world is that she just needs 
better intel.&nbsp; Yes, she will say intel, it sounds more objective.<br /><br />In
 order for the Time reader to have formed the quoted 
thought two other thoughts had to have occurred already, which in itself
 is astonishing, here they are:
1. She's figured out that all American news is biased, she's sick of the
 partisanship, after all, it doesn't brand identify her.&nbsp;
2.  She thinks that <i>more</i> objectivity is to be found at Al-Jazeera America. <br /><br />Why
 would she think this?  Because she's stupid?&nbsp;  Actually, yes: the 
culture you know least about has all the answers, which is also why the 
<a href="http://thelastpsychiatrist.com/2013/09/real_men_want_to_drink_guinnes.html">Guinness ad</a> hypermale in pre-season Special Olympics has chosen to tattoo gigantic Chinese characters on his 
arm to explain his ennui to himself.&nbsp; "It's a chinese proverb, 'That what 
doesn't kill me make me stronger.'"&nbsp; I hope to God a bus tries to make
 you stronger.&nbsp; Off topic, as a sociological metric, you can track a 
chinese person's first level of alienation from his culture by his branding 
himself with English-word tattoos; but you will know that all the 
chinese has been media powerwashed out of him when the he starts getting
 <i>Chinese</i> character tattoos.&nbsp; "It's because I'm Chinese," he'd 
explain, to which you would not dare reply, "yeah, I kinda figured."&nbsp; To
 which he will then not 
reply, "I mean, I know I'm genetically Chinese, but I don't really feel 
Chinese, but this signals that I'm part of a symbolic China more 
authentic than the actual China of my parents which I feel no real 
connection to, yet I know I'm supposed to feel the connection, it's not 
like I can go around pretending I grew up on Waltzing Matilda."&nbsp; To 
which you will not add, "It's not entirely your fault, you 
didn't live through a war like your parents and grandparents did, and 
anyway modern China
 resembles the U.S. far more than it does symbolic China.&nbsp; Technically, 
you're alienated from your parents alienation, but neither are you 
connected to Americana either, the white girls/boys seem out of reach, there's
 a frivolity you can't really empathize with, jobs other than Law, 
Medicine, Science are unreal, and you feel like you're always looking at
 everything from an outside that itself has no firm location."&nbsp; And he'll blink, 
confused, "truth be told, my only real association to chinese culture is
 my parents screaming at me that I'm not as good as 'real' Chinese.&nbsp; 
What can be done?"&nbsp; I don't have an answer for you, the good news is that when you finally find the answer that works for you, your kids will be too old to care.<br /><br />Al-Jazeera America is trying to call itself "objective", but right in the ad is the brand reveal: she doesn't want objectivity, she 
wants subjectivity explained to her, she wants to know how the news relates to <i>her</i>.&nbsp; She wants to know: how can I, an organ donor in 
Sector 3, be part of the global community now that my husband is boring 
and my kids prefer their individual LCD screens?&nbsp; The media wants her to
 have an answer,&nbsp; after all, do you know how many Nielsen ratings that 
family generates, how individualized is the data?&nbsp; It's not the quality of the news at AJA she likes, but how watching it makes her feel smart, unique.&nbsp; She's not going to watch Fox, MSNBC and AJA, right?&nbsp; Only one of those, but AJA brands her as out of the mainstream, unique, open to other opinions.&nbsp; "I like 
to get 
my information from different sources."&nbsp; I assume that includes twitter,
 140 characters and an appeal to authority and you're good to go at the 
Starbucks.<br /><br /><br />V.<br /><br />To be clear, I'm not at all worried Al
 Jazeera is 
going to secretly convert this woman into a jihadist or spread 
misinformation and disinformation.&nbsp; I have no 
doubt Al Jazeera will be as objective as CNN, after all they took
 Soledad O'Brien from them to signal that very point.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />So when I say AJA is (pre-)propaganda, I don't mean it won't be accurate, I mean that it's purpose is to prepare its demo for a certain way of life.&nbsp; Of course everything I've said applies to any American media-- except that Al Jazeera offers something else the American networks don't or can't.&nbsp; If you want to know what Al Jazeera is really offering, take a look at its aspirational target demo:<br /><br /><br /><img alt="AJA ad hispanic.jpg" src="http://thelastpsychiatrist.com/images/AJA%20ad%20hispanic.jpg" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" height="385" width="400" /><br /><br /><br /><img alt="AJA ad black LA times.jpg" src="http://thelastpsychiatrist.com/images/AJA%20ad%20black%20LA%20times.jpg" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" height="473" width="400" /><br /><img alt="aja ad woman.jpg" src="http://thelastpsychiatrist.com/images/aja%20ad%20woman.jpg" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" height="385" width="341" /><br /><br /><br />Not pictured is a white guy in a suit, because he already has media that's for him, and it's probably Fox, and the above four people hate it.&nbsp; That's powerful branding in America: in opposition to what you hate.<br /><br />Women and minorities may not seem like an aspirational demo, but it is-- not for actual women and minorities necessarily, but for people suffering from tremendous ennui who want to be part of a struggle, something bigger than themselves.<br /><br />They feel, without fully comprehending this to be true,&nbsp; that the only
 reason the American media is so partisan and loud and angry and urgent is because nothing really important is happening.&nbsp; Yes, there's a countdown
 clock on CNN for Debt Ceiling Armageddon and I guess Kanye West is headed for the asylum but 
it's all boy who cried wolf blitzer at this point.&nbsp; She heard, like you 
heard, that the NSA is monitoring us, and you know what?&nbsp; Meh.&nbsp; Though it was interesting when it was on <i>The Good Wife</i>.&nbsp; This isn't to say things are going well, it is to say they are degrading boringly.&nbsp; Like the above woman's marriage.<br /><br />This
 is what Al Jazeera promises her, not objectivity, but a connection to history.&nbsp; Our big
 crisis is... whether or we aren't going to pay our <i>short term</i> debts. You think either of the four people above can get hyped about that?&nbsp; But over in the middle east history is happening, racial 
equality, women's lib, the right to get an education, riots, ideological 
clashes-- all that stuff is happening over
 there.&nbsp; Women are being stoned to death for seeing a penis, gay men, too, if you assume that at some point in some future these things will no longer be true, then you are saying that historical changes are afoot as the old ways are replaced, and by ways I mean men.&nbsp;&nbsp; The #OWS demo wants to see powerful men humbled before the t-shirted, tweeting masses, it allows them the fantasy that it could some day happen here, which it won't because the propaganda worked.<br /><br />Propaganda doesn't succeed because it is manipulative, it works because people WANT it, NEED it, it gives their life a direction and meaning and guards against change.<br /><br />Fans of AJA will probably attack me for being biased, but this accusation is silly.&nbsp; The whole point here is that the target demo for AJA is not smart, and I know this because no one smart would watch TV news.&nbsp; If you are watching TV 
news, then you're not smart, this isn't me saying this, this is TV news predicting this: no one smart would ever ask another person, let alone the news, to explain to them how the news relates to them.&nbsp; TV news thinks you're as stupid as Time Magazine.<br /><br /> If anything, 
Al-Jazeera isn't the "Islamification" of the west, it is the 
westernization of the middle east. &nbsp; Al Jazeera reports in English, they
 have western values, and, most importantly, accept ads--&nbsp; 
western <i>style </i>ads, i.e aspirational, not representational.&nbsp;&nbsp; The neocons couldn't have planned this 
better, someone should check to see if they didn't.&nbsp; Two months of Al 
Jazeera and this woman will turn to her then deceased husband in a moment of big picture clarity and say, 
"you know, they're not so different from us, they want the same things 
we want." Yes.&nbsp; Why do you think that is?&nbsp; Evolution?<br /><br />The news for Americans, especially Independents, lacks meaning, direction, ideology-- and they miss it, just like economically, they've been left behind.&nbsp; Now the news is artificial drama,&nbsp; just local crime stories blown up nationally, a natural disaster, the occasional Youtube video-- where's the Change, where are the upheavals, where are the riot police?&nbsp; We don't have political riots here, we have high end sit ins near the Broadway Starbucks, and occasionally 20 motorcycles will attack a minivan.&nbsp; "Is 'motorcycle' code?"&nbsp; That's where we are right now, this is what the media has trained you for, detecting racism or hypocrisy or some other character flaw in the speaker as a proxy for the complexities of the issues so you don't have to think.&nbsp; It is under these conditions that you expect John Boehner to "compromise" on something you don't at all understand, and scream for his beheading if he doesn't, all to the thrill of the media.&nbsp; "See!&nbsp; TLP is a right wing zealot!"&nbsp; See, you're stupid.&nbsp; And boy oh boy do I have the news network for you.<br /><br /><br /><div><br /></div>]]>

Click this ad.  It's great, the internet told me so, it says it represents something good about humanity.  You're going to cry and feel good about the future and then consider ordering a Guinness.&nbsp;  That is, unless you already like Guinness and then you're going to have a totally different reaction, like switching to Belhaven.<br /><br /><br /><br />

<br /><br /><br /><i>"The choices we make reveal the true nature of our character."</i><br /><br />Yeah, we're sheep.&nbsp; Message received.&nbsp; That wasn't the message?&nbsp; Are you sure?<br /><br />According to social critics around the internet this ad is "such a refreshing change", "great to see sensitivity and strength combined",&nbsp; "promotes a new kind of masculinity."&nbsp; I'd like to know what was wrong with the old masculinity?&nbsp; The one featured on <i>Game Of Thrones</i>?&nbsp; Was it too masculine?<br /><br />Before you applaud this ad for "breaking the mold of beer adverts" you would do well to remember that all ads are aspirational, not representational, and for sure not inspirational, i.e. the ad thinks this will work on the target demo because it describes an aspirational image for the demo, i.e. i.e. the ad has made several important assumptions about the kind of person who would like this ad-- <i>not the product, the ad</i>-- and you're not going to like them.&nbsp; Still don't see it?&nbsp; Take yourself back to 1990. What would this ad have looked like?<br /><br />In 1990, the ad would have shown the masculinity and heroism of the <i>crippled guy</i>: him, in his 
chair, keeping up with the bipeds, both physically and mentally, taking shots and landing zingers.<br /><br /><br /><div align="center"><i><b>Wheels (laughing): <br /></b></i></div><i><br />You still throwing bricks?&nbsp; What is this, a Masons' convention?&nbsp; I got an idea, let's just gather up all these bricks and build a shelter for the homeless so your mom has a place to live.<br /><br /></i><div align="center"><i><b>Group (laughing): <br /></b></i></div><i><br />Oh no he didn't just bring up your momma!<br /><br /></i><div align="center"><i><b>Biped (laughing): </b><br /></i></div><i><br />Can someone sub in for Mr. Motherfucking March Of Dimes?&nbsp; He needs to take off for two hours to watch 60 Minutes.<br /><br /></i><div align="center"><i><b>Group (laughing): </b><br /></i></div><i><br />Ooooohhhhhh!&nbsp; Snap!&nbsp; His momma looks like Morley Safer!<br /><br /></i><div align="center"><i><b>Wheels (laughing, fouling a tree ent):&nbsp; <br /></b></i></div><i><br />Sorry, you either smoke or you get smoked.&nbsp; And you got SMOKED!<br /><br /></i><div align="center"><i><b>Biped (laughing): <br /></b></i></div><i><br />Tree ent! Oh, that's funny on two levels!!<br /><br /><br />(<b>Wheels</b> shoots but is blocked by <b>Biped</b>)<br /><br /></i><div align="center"><i><b>Biped (laughing):</b></i><br /></div><i><br /><br />It's true, white men can't jump!<br /><br /><br /><br />("good game", high fives all around.)<br /><br /></i><div align="center"><i><b>Voice Over:<br /></b></i></div><i><br />A real man doesn't see limits.&nbsp; He doesn't see disability.&nbsp; He takes on whatever life throws his way, sets up, and shoots for 3.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's not about the best trick shot,&nbsp; it's about points on the board.&nbsp; And the way he handles the rebounds will define him as a man.&nbsp; Life is a team sport, and most people play to lose.&nbsp; For the winners, there's Guinness.</i><br /><br />Then we'd pass the bong around and watch <i>Simon &amp; Simon</i> reruns.&nbsp; I may not be remembering everything accurately, it was a long time ago.<br /><br />But this ad does the exact opposite: it shows a bunch of "men"-- signaled by the modern exterrnal cues of tricep tattoos, wide gaits and carefully managed stubble-- playing <i>down</i> to Davros's level, not as a one time offering, but as a <i>regular weekly game</i>.&nbsp; <br /><br />That's very sensitive, but, just curious, do these guys who grab a shower in the locker room have another weekly basketball game where they play standing up, or is this all it takes to satisfy their interest in recreational athletics?&nbsp; Because I can't imagine anyone who actually likes playing basketball to be able to do it only this way.&nbsp; Perhaps their Cosmo girlfriends give them <i>two</i> evenings off a week for bro-ing?&nbsp; <br /><br />Get ready for a super-sexist comment that is nevertheless 100% true, good thing my rum makes me impervious to your idiotic criticisms: reducing yourself because you think it's a show of solidarity is a straight up chick thing to do, see also Slut Walks and crying excessively for the deceased.&nbsp; It was super-brave that Kellie Pickler shaved her head to support her friend with breast cancer, but what the hell was the point?&nbsp; "Breast cancer awareness!"&nbsp; Isn't that what the implants are for?<br /><br /><br /><div align="center"><img alt="kellie-pickler-300.jpg" src="http://thelastpsychiatrist.com/images/kellie-pickler-300.jpg" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" height="400" width="300" /> getting the message out<br /></div><br /><br /><br />The most generous interpretation of her "look at me" behavior would be, "I'm supporting my friend, showing that people can be beautiful even without hair, especially if they have a spectacular body and a national dance show, and a glam squad, and a wig, and are not on chemo."&nbsp; Message received, oncology can bite me, I'm calling a stylist.<br /><br />I can hear the grumbling, so I'll make a slight modification: only a woman would <i>allow </i>another person to reduce themselves in a show of support.&nbsp; When Joseph Gordon-Levitt improvised the head shaving scene in <i>50/50</i>,&nbsp; Seth Rogen didn't then grab the hedge clippers and say, "I'm not going to let my BFF feel bad about himself"&nbsp; because that would be, you know, ___________________.&nbsp; "Is it gay?"&nbsp; "No, no, is it retarded?"&nbsp; You're both right.&nbsp; Everyone's a winner!<br /><br />I could use this ad as a commentary about the wussification of America, "the guilt of privilege",&nbsp; the Land Of Sensitivity Training, etc, etc, but that would be wrong and anyway I don't have that kind of time.&nbsp; I started writing a porn book, this book has become my own personal nightmarish Hamlet, a scary real life example of what the "return of the repressed" looks like, and FYI it looks horrifying. Remember the scene in <i>Ju-On</i> where whatever the hell that ghost thing is materializes in the window, not to look at anyone specifically, but... only <i>to reveal that it is watching?</i> <br /><br /><img alt="ju-on.jpg" src="http://thelastpsychiatrist.com/images/ju-on.jpg" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" height="322" width="500" /><br />According to psychoanalysis, this is what turns me on.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />II.<br /><br />All of the psychologically necessary praise for this ad can be attributed to two things: 1) It's for Guinness, which is already a kind of masculine product;&nbsp; 2) the woefully deluded premise that ads try to sell you on a product.&nbsp; Oh my God, what year is this?&nbsp; Stop it, this is WRONG.<br /><br />Ads do not try to sell you a product, is <i>Mad Men</i> canceled yet?&nbsp; On that now unwatchable soap opera Creative stays up all night eating chinese and trading tag lines, trying to capture the essence of the product.&nbsp; Essence of the product-- for whom?&nbsp; In fairness, back then there was only one TV and one wallet per household, so demos tended to be a little more broad, by which I mean women.&nbsp; Fair enough, and not anymore.&nbsp; Now ads target a specific demographic, and tailor an aspirational message/image for that demo on which is piggybacked whatever product paid for the take out. THE PRODUCT IS IRRELEVANT.&nbsp; Write it down on a sticky note next to A-B-C, it will help.<br /><br />If the ad works you will consequently want the product no matter what it is, baaaaa, this is what I mean when I say ads teach you not what to want but how to want.&nbsp; You could use this exact same Guinness ad to sell something as unmasculine as guar gum flavored ice cream and it would work just as well, and I know this because<br /><br /><br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/dD0RdImzoRM?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" width="480"></iframe></div><br /><br />While you wonder who copied what and why they bothered let me observe a key difference between this Indian ad and the American: in the Indian ad, <i>everyone is handicapped, and the one biped joins in</i>.&nbsp; His innate importance is signaled by his Iverson jersey, keep in mind this is 2006.&nbsp; That's your metaphor for an aspirational, westernized, privileged but still socially conscious young man in India surrounded by... the rest of India.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br /><br />III.&nbsp; <br /><br />My interest here is not the tricks the ad uses to get you to like Guinness, but what the fact of the existence of such an ad says about American men today.&nbsp; It's bad.&nbsp; It's really, really bad.<br /><br />Let's go back to the assumptions the ad makes about its target demo.&nbsp; What is the target demo?&nbsp; Think about this.&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Not who drinks Guinness already</i>, this is not a "brand reinforcement" ad.&nbsp; Who are the people the ad is trying to <i>attract</i>? &nbsp; The ad doesn't comment on Guinness <i>drinkers</i>, it is making assumptions about people who like the ad.&nbsp; Who is the ad trying to attract?<br /><br />"Is it paraplegics?"&nbsp; That's a weird guess.&nbsp; "Is it basketball players?"&nbsp; I'm going to assume that's code, no.&nbsp; "Is it 30 something guys who play basketball and then go to bars to meet women?"&nbsp; No, that's Heineken's gimmick.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aspirational-- look at the ad: who is <i>not </i>those men, but considers <i>them</i> masculine, sees something more masculine than themselves?&nbsp; <br /><br />It's beta males.  The best of men,
 except for actual men.&nbsp; What is a beta male?&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>He is the kind of man who anxiously looks for something to identify him as a <b>man</b>, while doing nothing to become a man.&nbsp; </i>For him, there's Guinness.<br /><br />"Hold on.&nbsp; You're saying that Guinness assumes if I like this ad I'm like, a... loser?"&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; <i>Or a girl</i>.&nbsp; Tagline:<br /><br /><br /><br />Dedication.<br /><br />Loyalty.<br /><br />Friendship.<br /><br /><br />I'm sorry, is this an ad for beer or golden retrievers?&nbsp; Why not "good nutrition" or "isn't always yapping about her frenemies"? Just because the guy saying them sounds like a man doesn't mean these words are branding for men. Usually "male" values are the things you have to teach or encourage people to do, like bravery, or sacrifice, or stoicism, where the default, the easier thing, is to not do those things.&nbsp;&nbsp; Dedication and friendship don't code for men, they are too basic for men, they code simply for person, although women get associated with them because... not much more is expected of women.&nbsp; For whatever reason society has made the observation that women seem to be worse at friendship then men, and that reason is called TV, way to set the bar really really low, Shonda.&nbsp; "You're... my... person."&nbsp; Ugh, Jesus, someone Silkwood me.&nbsp; It's not that these values are inferior, it's that you can't imagine someone else needs to praise them-- or that any person alive or dead would feel good about themselves for having them-- or would seek to be described this way.&nbsp; "I'm a good friend."&nbsp; Of course you are, there's no sacrifice involved, plus it gives you someone to talk at.&nbsp; This Guinness ad is for the demographic that aspires to positive experiences and pretend challenges buried in rhetorical cover so to avoid the guilt about its meaninglessness.&nbsp; "The cedar roasted asparagus has good chew. I don't know how to enjoy it, so I'll Instagram it."<br /><br />Wheelchair b-ball is nice but it has nothing 
to do with being a man or masculinity, or females and femininity, or anything, and the point here is that the 
public's desire to link it to masculinity is a sign of three very bad things: a) a pervasive sense of insecurity and inadequacy in many men which has a precise psychoanalytic characterization that I will not elaborate on here and which the ad reassures you is soooo not true, you loyal friend, you-- you're a real man; b) another example of the media teaching people how to want, how to think, in this case about themselves; c) the 
general public's exhaustion with masculine men who don't deliver on their 
masculinity,&nbsp; i.e. and e.g. getting the check.  <br /><br />"I think your interpretation of the ad is wrong."&nbsp; Maybe this is the Dexedrine talking, but I think you liked the ad.&nbsp; Do a system check: did you like the ad?&nbsp; "Well, I kinda liked the song."&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; That's why it was also in <i>Grey's Anatomy</i>.&nbsp; <br /><br />IV.<br /><br />You may have heard that it's hard to be a modern woman because of "the impossible expectations media sets", but you should try it from the penis side.&nbsp;&nbsp; Not measuring up in America generates a distinct response in men, let's see if I can elicit it in you.&nbsp; No?&nbsp; Wanna bet?<br /><br />Here's an ad that is female analogue of the Guinness ad, i.e. it played on the same show and time.&nbsp; Let's run the experiment.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/lRqZ7JejbPQ?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="293" width="520"></iframe></div><br /><br /><br />Storyboard:&nbsp; <i>Raining.&nbsp; Pretty brunette in Iris &amp; Ink trench and skirt sufficiently above the knee comes out of a Lean In and, oopsy, she has no umbrella. Oh my God, that's so hysterical.&nbsp; So she runs to a passing salaryman and huddles underneath his.&nbsp;&nbsp; He's surprised, obviously, the last half-Asian to come up on a white guy in the rain was The Ring and we all know how that ended.&nbsp; (Code for "Asian" by walking by a Chinese restaurant.)&nbsp; She gazes into his eyes.&nbsp; "We're headed the same way, right?"&nbsp; she NLPs.&nbsp; "Yeah!" he responds, but five steps later you can see his pacemaker go off as she blue balls him for another umbrella that crosses their path, this time a basketball player's.&nbsp;</i> (Everybody still with me? Let's keep going.)&nbsp; <i>A few steps later, she froggers off towards the next passing guy, and when she settles in their eye contact lingers for longer than this married guy has had in a decade.&nbsp;&nbsp; "After you," she says in some kind of way that means some kind of thing.&nbsp;&nbsp; Three more steps, and she dumps him and his thrifty tote bag for a luxury SUV.&nbsp;&nbsp; She closes the door, a sigh of relief.&nbsp; She made it.</i><br /><br />So?&nbsp; How do you feel?&nbsp; Here's the tag line: "it's all in how you get there."&nbsp; Well, how did she get there?<br /><br />Here's one interpretation: she's a cunt, by which I mean a woman. &nbsp; The commercial represents a reality about women, hopping from guy to guy, taking, taking,&nbsp; taking.&nbsp; And that sigh at the end was what she really thinks of men.&nbsp; =choads.<br /><br />You'll observe that this harpy never said thank you, she never even said excuse me.&nbsp; She just assumed it was ok, she was entitled, the world belongs to women, and when she got as far as his five and a half inches could take her, she was off to the next guy, black guys and homewrecking.&nbsp; Even better, she is proud of how she pulled it off, because getting to her car isn't the only goal, learning how to manipulate emasculated men is just as important, note she never used a woman.&nbsp; The tag line reminds women that they shouldn't feel to guilty about it, men are dispensable.&nbsp;&nbsp; As an aside, buy a Cadillac.<br /><br />That's one interpretation, but the striking thing about the ad is how she explicitly did not slut 
her way from man to man.&nbsp; All she did was ask to use their umbrella-- 
and got it. That's the Female Power.&nbsp; What's enraging isn't that women 
are sluts, but that they are not sluts-- that they are able to 
manipulate men, get what they want, <i>without paying for it</i>.&nbsp; That message to female viewers is what gets men angry.<br /><br />The problem with this analysis is that it assumes the message is for women only, as if women are the ones who buy themselves Cadillacs, and as if men would not be exposed to this commercial except by a wife who drags her husband over to it, "oooh, look at this great ad!&nbsp; I want a car!"&nbsp; But this ad was on at 4pm on ESPN, same time as the Guinness ad, 
for the specific male demographic that... is home watching ESPN at 4pm, e.g. guys home at 2.&nbsp; What's the aspirational message to those men? &nbsp;
She's exactly the kind of 
woman they wish was in love with them.&nbsp; "I want the kind of woman with max female power, that 
can get anything she wants, and that everyone wants, but no one can get-- 
and she picked me."&nbsp; See also female superheroes.<br /><br />Ok, but <i>why does she need to manipulate men</i>?&nbsp; What does the ad assume that women assume about men?<br /><br />There's a gigantic error in the ad, yet to most people the ad is totally believable, like this is a&nbsp; hidden camera vid, this error is invisible to them; and if this error was corrected this ad would have never been possible.&nbsp; Do you see it?&nbsp; <i>Why didn't one of these "men"&nbsp; just walk her to her car?</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; Three guys, not one thought of this?&nbsp; She's under your umbrella and your natural instinct was not to protect, to help?&nbsp; So wrapped up in what it all means and power imbalances that you couldn't just... behave?&nbsp; Ok, forget about chivalry-- out of sheer selfishness, a hail mary 
longshot?&nbsp; Sure, no expectations, but what the hell, let's see where it goes, maybe she'll ask you out for a Guinness?&nbsp; Were you so insulted by her "entitlement" that you
 couldn't just try?&nbsp; Or so flustered because a woman <i>that you have stripped of her ordinary humanity and forced her to be a symbol of value</i> chose to be near you, your brain couldn't&nbsp; figure out what to do next?&nbsp; In which case her decision to leave you for another umbrella was astutely correct, odd how she and the commercial knew that.&nbsp; All men are good for is an umbrella <i>because she cannot rely on men to act like... men</i>.<br /><br />The point is not simply that those men should have walked her to her car, the point is that the ad knew with 100% certainty that it would not occur to any man watching to do this; that it would not occur to any woman watching that it's weird no man thought to do this.&nbsp; Meanwhile, what did occur to men was that she's a jerk.<br /><br />Look at it from your daughter's perspective: should she date the guy who walks her to her car, or the guy who doesn't walk her to her car?&nbsp; "You can't judge based on that!"&nbsp; What else can I judge on?&nbsp; Didn't you judge her based on her wanting to stay dry?<br /><br />"Hold on.&nbsp; You're saying that Cadillac assumes if I hate this ad I'm like, a... loser?"&nbsp; Etc, and so forth.&nbsp; Love and hate are opposites for lovers, not ads, for 
ads the goal is to stimulate want through any emotion convenient.<br /><br />Tagline: Ladies, it's all in how you get there, because you're on your own. <br /><br />This is what the ad is telling women, and you, its foundational assumption: the public's exhaustion with men who don't deliver on their masculinity, their general loss of ambition, drive, respectfulness... and purpose; coupled with men's haunting suspicion that their true worth-- "in other people's minds"-- is signaled by women's opinions of them, after all, money, jobs-- all that is fake.&nbsp; Hence the need for something to redefine masculinity, to make it real.<br /><br />"Well, feminism has emasculated men."&nbsp; Really?&nbsp; A girl did that to you?<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />V.<br /><br />The Guinness ad proposes that what makes men men is that they don't act like stereotypical men, if and only if they look like stereotypical men, otherwise they're not men.&nbsp; That sentence is 100% correct, but it could only have been written by a madman.&nbsp; Reshoot that commercial&nbsp; using the cast of <i>The Big Bang Theory</i> and the entire aspirational message is obliterated.&nbsp; The mere fact that they took stereotypical-<i>looking</i> men to use as contrasts to "stereotypical men" means they themselves assume that "stereotypical men" are indeed the real men, everyone else is waiting to be labeled, by some other omnipotent entity, that they are close.&nbsp; And if this is confusing, just change "men" to "women."<br /><br />It's confusing because the Guinness ad is a mess of signals and symbols that you usually only see purposely mixed together for 
parody, like a Hooters waitress who also turns out to be really smart.<br /><br /><br />

<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Ok, she's only smart at mixology and football, but to a guy watching ESPN at 4 in the afternoon, not coincidentally the same place/time the Guinness ad and Rainy Run were running, this signals as genius.&nbsp; The question is, why would the demo watching this want her to be smart ALSO?&nbsp; Look at her, what more do you want?&nbsp; Which is the same question as, why would the demo watching this want the Guinness guys to be "a new kind of masculinity"?&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the precise origin of the <i>want</i>?<br /><br />Look at the guy in the chair, gentlemen of 4pm football, that guy is aspirational you.&nbsp; I'm told&nbsp; Vitamin E is some kind of battalion leader, but the only reason <i>she </i>is talking to <i>him </i>is because she is smart, i.e. the fantasy for the viewer is that to talk to a girl <i>like her</i> he doesn't have to be interesting, engaging, witty or cool, let alone young or attractive; she's "smart" and likes "smart guys" so she's happy to stick around and talk to "smart" guys about the things that interest <i>them</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, "smart" here carries the loosest possible definition so it can apply to 4pm Disney affiliates, but the point is no different than if she was solving for x.&nbsp; You don't have to woo her on her terms (whatever they may be), she's ready to meet you on yours.<br /><br />At this point you will no doubt think that the fantasy here is to be able to score a Hooters waitress or a 36-24-30 but this is neither true for you nor for the ad.&nbsp; The point for the ad isn't her as physically attractive but her as a type-- a Hooters Waitress-- if she was thirty pounds heavier but still had the same attention to her appearance (makeup, etc), and adopted the style and mannerisms of hot girls then she would still cause that kind of approach anxiety, she would still be such a symbol, I'm pretty sure this is the entire gimmick of the Kardashians.&nbsp; I know this is going to sound like madness, but 8/10 that approach anxiety is defensive, you think you want something you really do not want, that person is not for you, I don't mean not good for you, I mean you do not really want this; but anyway the point here is that the ad mixes up the symbols as humor, to fool you into thinking that what's humorous is that this type could play against type; but the horrifying, Ju-On reality is that the symbol ceases to be a symbol for you the moment she violates her own symbolism-- the moment you get to know <i>her</i>-- and then the <i>want </i>DISAPPEARS.&nbsp; Just like fear.&nbsp; If that ghost in the window so much as coughs like reality you will scale the wall and <i>beat it the fuck out</i>.<br /><br />And I know all this is true because the ads told me so, in order. &nbsp; You're going to be infuriated at this blonde Hooters Waitress for only being attracted to chiseled abs and a commanding phallus, but even if she miraculously chose to come under your umbrella, you'd see suddenly&nbsp; she was only a brunette, huh, and you still wouldn't do anything about it.&nbsp; And off she goes, a missed opportunity.&nbsp; And before that ignites your amygdala into a blinding self-hatred, you will remember that it's all the cunt's fault, and besides, never mind all these girls, the fact that you're a good friend to your less fortunate friend is what makes you a man; but since you are not actually a good friend, indeed, you don't even have any friends, well, this ad will signal to yourself that you are.&nbsp; Message received.<br /><br />As an aside, drink Guinness.<br /><br /><br /><br />]]>

        <![CDATA[<b>WHERE DID YOU GO?</b><br /><br />I flatter myself by thinking you are asking this question.&nbsp; I am writing a book of and about porn.<br /><br />]]>
        <![CDATA[<br /><br /><b>IS IT ANY GOOD?</b><br /><br />Not sure.&nbsp; I am trying my best.&nbsp; It's a lot of work, complicated by relentless self-doubt.&nbsp; The good news is I am drinking more.<br /><br /><br /><b>ALMOST DONE?</b><br /><br />Yes, guy who asks all the right questions.<br /><br /><br /><b>WILL YOU THEN RETURN TO THE BLOG?</b><br /><br />Yes.&nbsp; The blog is very good practice. <br /><br /><br /><b>IN THE MEANTIME, DO YOU RECOMMEND ANY OF YOUR OLD POSTS?</b><br /><br />No.&nbsp;
 
Read at your own risk/tolerance, I distance myself from everything older
 than, say, the last four or five posts.&nbsp; Everything else is thinking 
out loud, work in progress.&nbsp; I could go back and try to revise the old 
posts, but there's no point.&nbsp; Life is change, have to keep moving 
forward.<br /><br /><br /><b>IF YOU HAD TO PICK ONE OR TWO...?</b><br /><br /><i>The Second Story of Echo and Narcissus</i> and <i>The Boy Who Cried Wolf</i>.<br /><br /><br /><b>WHY A BOOK?</b><br /><br />I
 didn't want to put a porn story on the blog, I felt there should be a 
buffer.&nbsp; Wait-- are you asking me why I didn't just shoot a sex tape?&nbsp; 
Huh.<br /><br /><br /><b>SO YOU WROTE AN ACTUAL PORN STORY?</b><br /><br />Yes.<br /><br /><br /><b>HARDCORE PORN?</b><br /><br />Yes.<br /><br /><br /><b>IS IT HETERONORMATIVE?</b><br /><br />Sigh.<br /><br />



The
book is in two parts.  The first part is a
straight up porn short story.&nbsp;   There's penis
and vagina and lots of cum/ming.&nbsp;  I have deliberately not written the
story "well", whatever that means, I am imitating the flow
and style of that kind of story.  I didn't try to make it sensual or unusual; while it is hard core pornography it is a fairly
vanilla story-- boy vs. girl, no vampires, no
one dies-- obvious in its language and plot and etc.    My goal
wasn't to elevate the genre but to photograph it.&nbsp;   I did this so
that you could assure yourself that there is nothing meaningful
there, no symbolism-- just explicit porn.&nbsp; And then
to business.<p></p>

<br /><b>DO YOU TRY TO EXPLAIN THE PSYCHOLOGICAL MECHANISMS OF PORN?</b><br /><br />No.&nbsp;
 It's not the deconstruction of a text, it is the interpretation of a 
dream.&nbsp; I make no attempt to explain what porn means in general, only 
what it means to you.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><b>HOW CAN YOU KNOW WHAT IT MEANS TO ME?</b><br /><br />The important thing is to say whatever comes to mind.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>"Dude, are you doing the Dove ad <i>now</i>?  That was so April 15th...?"  Yes, I realize I missed the meme train, but it's better to be right than part of the debate, especially when there is no debate, this is all a short con inside a 50+ year long con.  Remember <i>House Of Games</i>?  "It's called a confidence game. Why, because you give me your confidence?  No: because I give you mine."<br /><br />"What's with you and <i>fin-de-Reagan</i> David Mamet?"  It's not my fault Dove cast Joe Mantegna as the sketch artist, and anyway if you want to understand the world today, you have to understand how the Dumbest Generation of Narcissists In The History Of The World was educated.  See also: <i>9 1/2 Weeks</i>.  <br /><br />Here's how you run a short con, pay attention:<br /><br /><br /></p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<iframe width="500" height="281" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/Riy4God934c?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</div>
<p><br /><br />Everyone likes to know the secrets of the game, and this scene certainly satisfies. Joe Mantagena shows a famous psychiatrist (played, tellingly, by David Mamet's future ex-wife) how a short con is done, how it's improvised, and he makes it look so easy.  Really easy, except for the part where you have to connect with a perfect stranger and make them like you.  Did you find yourself wondering if you had the skills to pull it off?  Better watch it again, sucker.<br /><br />Quick test for a con: what questions does it not occur to you to ask?  While you were memorizing the language and the pacing of the scam, you didn't ask yourself, why didn't Mantegna take that guy's money at the end?  Why did he let him off the hook?  "He was just doing it as an example." Oh, like when a guy says he'll put in just the tip, "I want to see if it fits"?   It's not like the psychiatrist doesn't know he's a thief-- that's why they were there in the first place.   So he purposely didn't steal the money to make the psychiatrist feel at ease, feel closer to him.  To earn her confidence by first giving her his.  <i>She's the mark.</i>  The aborted short con is part of an unseen long con.<br /><br />But the genius of the scene is that while you, the viewer, are criticizing the stilted dialogue or the improbability of the success, "dude, that would never work in real life!" if you search your sclerotic heart you will find that you yourself <i>felt good</i> that Mantegna didn't take that guy's money, that he let him go.  It endeared you to Joe, it made you feel more sympathetic to him, like he's an ethical thief, like he's Lawful Neutral.  In other words, he's given you his confidence.... which means that the true mark is you.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></p>

<blockquote>Women are their own worst beauty critics.... At Dove, we are committed to creating a world where beauty is a source of confidence, not anxiety... That's why we decided to conduct a compelling social experiment that proves to women something very important: You are more beautiful than you think.</blockquote>
<p><br /><br />"Oh my God," you might say, "I know it's just an ad, but it's such a positive message."<br /><br />If some street hustler challenges you to a game of three card monte you don't need to bother to play, just hand him the money, not because you're going to lose but because you owe him for the insight: he <em>selected</em> you.  Whatever he saw in you everyone sees in you, from the dumb blonde at the bar to your elderly father you've dismissed as out of touch, the only person who doesn't see it is you, which is why you fell for it.  Even mirrors fail you.  Hence a sketch.<br /><br /><br />II.<br /><br />The gimmick that propels the Dove ad is a comparison between subjectivity and objectivity, though in this case objectivity is defined as however well Mantegna can use a charcoal pencil.  Why not just use a photograph?<br /><br />Because when it comes to beauty, we all know photographs can be manipulated, especially in ads, especially by Dove.  So the ad frees you from your cynicism and goes with a new standard of beauty, one that, like yoga or genetics, has been around for a long time AND you know very little about it; it hasn't been over-critiqued, you haven't watched it fail over and over, and thus seems pure, fantastical, true.  <i>The artist's sketch.</i>   How can anything this lovingly and precisely created not be the real thing?  And nothing makes a middle aged neurotic happier than 45 minutes alone in a loft with a good looking man who requires no sexual contact and just wants to listen to you talk about yourself, unless he's also sketching you attentively in natural light.  "Can I offer you a Pinot Grigio?"  Slow down, Christian, you're making me woozy.  There is not enough quantitative easing in the universe to prop up this fantasy, but at $3000000000000 you can't say America's not committed to the attempt.  <br /><br />The mistake in interpreting this ad is in assuming the ad is selling based on the women and their beauty.  If that were true, it would be counterproductive: if they are naturally beautiful, if the problem is actually a psychological one, then they certainly don't need any beauty products.  A beauty ad operates by <i>creating </i>a gap between you and an ideal: by creating an anxiety that can only be mitigated by the product.  But this ad reduces anxiety and avoids cynicism.  Therefore, it is not a beauty products ad.  It is selling something else.  This is why there aren't any products in the ad.<br /><br />Dove is telling you you don't need to do anything to be beautiful, but it knows full well women must do something <i>to</i> themselves to feel good <i>about </i>themselves, and if they don't need makeup then at least a moisturizing soap. All Dove needs to solidify this is to be recognized as an authority on beauty-- real beauty, not fake, Photoshopped, eyeliner and pushup bras beauty.  <br /><br />It is the sketch artist who is the most important character in the ad, the ad is selling him.  That's why he doesn't just draw the sketches, he sticks around to chaperone these women to self-awareness.  By the way he is depicted you understand that he knows beauty, inner and outer; he is part father, part lover, expert in what makes a woman valuable.  For you to accept him, he can't be married; but since in real life he is, they only show you the right hand-- the part of him that almost autonomously draws beauty.  He is an authority on appearance, he is the "other omnipotent entity" that decides whether  "you are beautiful."  <br /><br />The ad lets the women become beautiful without selling them anything.   It <i>lets </i>them win.  <i>It</i> lets them win.  It endears them and you to Dove, it makes you feel more sympathetic to Dove, like it's an ethical beauty products company, like it's Lawful Neutral.   It gave these women its confidence; it gave you, the viewer, its confidence.  <br /><br />And then-- spoiler alert-- it will screw you and take your money.<br /><br />III.<br /><br />That Dove wants you to think of it as the authority on beauty so it can sell you stuff makes sense, there's nothing underhanded about it and hardly worth the exposition.  The question is, why do they think this will work?  What do they know about us that makes them think we <i>want </i>an authority on beauty-- especially in an age where we loudly proclaim that we don't want an authority on beauty, we don't like authorities of any kind, we resist and resent being told what's beautiful (or good or moral or worthwhile) and what's not?<br /><br />You may feel your brain start trying to piece this together, but you should stop, there's a twist: <i>where did you see this ad?</i>   It wasn't during an episode of <i>The Mentalist</i> on the assumption that you're a 55 year old woman whose husband is "working late."  In fact... <i>it's not even playing anywhere.</i>   You didn't stumble on it, you were sent to it, it was sent to you-- it was <i>selected </i>for you to see.  How did they know?  <i>Because if you're watching it, it's for you.</i> <br /><br /> Here you have an ad that was released into the Matrix, it is not selling a product but its own authority, and it is not targeting a physical demo, age/race/class, it is targeting something else that operates not on demography but virality.  Are you susceptible?  So while you are sure you most certainly don't want an authority on beauty,  the system decided that you, in fact, do very much want an authority on beauty.  The question is, which of you is the rube?<br /><br />"But I hated the ad!"  Oh, I know, for all the middlebrow acceptable reasons you think you came up with yourself.  Not relevant.  The con artists at Dove didn't select these women to represent you because you are beautiful or ugly, any more than the street hustler selected you for your nice smile.   They were selected because they represent a psychological type that transcends age/race/class, it is characterized by a kind of psychological laziness: on the one hand, they don't want to have to conform to society's impossible standards, but on the other hand they don't want the existential terror of NOT conforming to some kind of standard.  They want an <i>objective</i> bar to be changed to fit them-- they want "some other omnipotent entity" to change it so that it remains both entirely valid yet still true for them, so that others <i>have to</i> accept it, and if you have no idea what I'm talking about look at your GPA: you know, and I know, that if college graded you based on the actual number of correct answers you generated, no curve, then you would have gotten an R.  Somehow that R became an A.  The question is, why bother?  Why not either make grades rigorous and valid so we know exactly what they mean, or else do away with them entirely?  Because in either case society and your head would implode from the existential vacuum.  Instead, everyone has to get As AND the As have to be "valid" so you feel good enough to pay next year's tuition, unfortunately leaving employers with no other choice but to look for other more reliable proxies of learning like race, gender, and physical appearance.  Oh.   Did you assume employers would be more influenced by the fixed grades than their own personal prejudices?   "Wait a second, I graduated 4.0 from State, and the guy you hired had a 3.2 from State-- the only reason you didn't hire me is because I'm a woman!"  Ok, this is going to sound really, really weird:  yeah.  The part that's going to really have you scratching your head is why did either of you need college when the job only requires a 9th grade education?<br /><br />Which is why those that yelled "Unilever owns Dove and Axe!" like it was an Alex Jones tweet, those who felt tricked/used/violated that Unilever has a sexist side to it, those who thought the ad was hypocritical or  "anti-feminist" are still being duped, detecting hypocrisy is 100% the play of the rube, go ahead and yell indignantly as you continue to be fleeced.  Figuring out the short con is part of the long con, see also <i>House Of Games</i>, for a non-spoiler example if the street hustler is shifting the cards and you think you're able to follow them, then you're still going to lose AND your pocket is being picked.  "Can't bluff someone who isn't paying attention," Mantegna told the shrink helpfully-- <i>he's telling her the scam</i>, no, she didn't listen either.   So let's go to the places where people pay attention, go to the "intelligent" media outlets where all the suckers hang out, and observe the most common criticism about this Dove ad: it has no black women in it.  Never mind it does, that's a very telling criticism: <i>why would you want black women in it?</i>  It's not the Senate, it's an ad, no, don't you hang up on me, why do you want blacks in the ad?  Because it would represent the diversity of beauty?  Because without them, it sends black women the wrong message about society's standards?  Your answer is irrelevant, the important part is that whatever your answer, it is founded on the assumption that ads have the authority to set standards.  Which is why, in your broken brain, the reflex is to complain about the contents of the ad, not assert the insignificance of ads.  The con worked.  Of course it worked: they <i>selected</i> you. <br /><br />"Well, not authority-- power.  You can't deny their power is massive, but of course I'm not a stupid, I don't think it's legitimate."  I'm sorry, no, you are stupid.  You'll let it have power over you <i>in exchange for the right</i> to brag that you know its not legitimate. <br /><br />This is the same problem with people who want to ban Photoshopping in magazines or want bigger women to be featured in ads.  You all have the internet, right?  It seems crazy to worry about how beauty is portrayed on TV and ads when there are blonde billions (rated on a scale of one to ten) getting double penetrated literally underneath your gmail window, but that obsessive worry about what's on TV or what's in an ad is completely predicated on the assumption that the ad, the media, has all the power to decide what's desirable.   And therefore, of course, it does.   But the important point is not that you <i>believe </i>this to be true, the point is that you <i>want</i> this to be true.  You want it to be true that advertising sets the standard of beauty because in the insane calculus of your psychology you have a better chance of changing Dove than you have of changing yourself, turns out that's true as well.<br /><br />Dove, et al sympathize with your powerlessness, so since you can't get anywhere near those  impossible standards, ads give you a chance of making some kind of progress: a little moisturizing soap and a positive message and maybe you get closer to the aspirational images of the women in the ad.  "Those women are aspirational?"  Of course: they're <i>happy</i>, Dad told them they're good.  It feels like improvement, it feels like change, and I hope by now you understand it's only a defense against change.<br /><br />The obvious retort is that ads are everywhere, you can't ignore them.  But there are rats in the ceiling of your favorite restaurant, and you ignore them no problem, you don't even look up.  That's the real Matrix you make for yourself continuously, in analog, not digital-- overestimate this, disavow that, a constant transduction of reality into a safe hue of green, until by the time you get to bed you're physically exhausted but your brain can't downshift.  "I have insomnia."  Time for a Xanax.  Yes, it's Blue.  <br /><br />"Everybody gets something out of every transaction," said Joe, explaining why people want to be conned.  That's what ads do for you.  They'll let you complain that they are telling you what to want, as long as you let them tell you how to want.  <br /><br />"Shouldn't my parents have taught me how to want, instead of yelling at me about what to want?"  You'd think that, let's check in: have you shown this ad to your 14 year old daughter yet?  Oh, you sent it to her on Facebook, that was helpful.  What did you tell her about the ad?  "Well, even though it's an ad and they're trying to sell you Dove soap, there's a positive message in it."  No other ways to deliver positive messages?  "Well, the ad is really well made, and it communicates the message more powerfully than I ever could."  But if the medium is the message, shouldn't you NOT show her this ad?<br /><br />David Mamet has some excellent insights, but for practice what you preach wisdom you have to defer to a Wachowski sister: stop letting the Matrix tell you who you are.   <br /><br /><br /><br />IV<br /><br />Did the way the sketching sessions were conducted remind you of anything?  The women aren't in yoga casual, no one's wearing sneakers-- they got a little dressed up for the appointment.  Observe the way they talk about themselves, trying to find just the right words because, you know, their inner experience is very complicated; and the unfinished, hesitating haste with which they take their handbags and walk out at the end leaving the artist behind.  The loft is certainly an inviting, comfortable setting, warm and safe, but it doesn't belong to them.  They know they are merely visitors in a shared space.  That setting is exactly like therapy.<br /><br />You may think this is merely my (a psychiatrist's/<i>House Of Games</i> viewer's) biased perception of this, except that a) they're in San Francisco, where the main output is  crematorium roast coffee and cash-only psychiatry, and b):<br /><br /></p>

<blockquote>My father was emotionally very distant-- and so was my mom.  And I didn't get the emotional comfort I needed...<br /><br />It's been really clear to me over my life that I've made really bad choices, and that's a reflection of my self esteem.  I chose the wrong jobs, the wrong husbands...<br /><br />I use a toolbox of things I tell myself.... whenever I hear negative thoughts about myself, I remind myself I have to use what's inside me, my authentic self, to feel good about how I am.</blockquote>
<p><br />This isn't every woman I've ever been stuck next to on the A train who spotted me with a psych journal or a flask, this monologue is in the ad.  Let's find out why: anybody watching this ad in therapy?  Anybody watching this ad ever fantasize about what it would be like being in therapy?  What a coincidence. <br /><br />This woman is roots deep in therapy, she thinks about herself in the language of "insight oriented therapy," how has this strategy worked out for her?<br /><br /><br /><br /><img alt="florence gray.jpg" src="http://thelastpsychiatrist.com/images/florence%20gray.jpg" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" height="429" width="321" /> <br /><br /><br /><br />Yikes, an Oscar Wilde novel.  But the thing to notice here is not that this thinking has failed but that this thinking has BOTH failed AND she thinks it has worked amazingly well for everything else EXCEPT her perception of her physical appearance, her self-esteem; only in that one single area does she "have more work to do on myself."   If you ask her about her capacity for empathy or her social/political beliefs or her "values"-- those aren't evolving, those are evolved, they are unassailable.  "I have a lot of love to give."  <i>How do you know?</i><br /><br />I'm not picking on her, any woman who has to raise two kids on her own or with a husband has my unconditional support, but truth hurts, that's how you know it's true. The confidence with which she <i>knows</i> how her perception of self-esteem affects everything in life, "it couldn't be more crucial" is not an insight, it is not wisdom gained from years of therapy: <i>she has been conned</i>, it is society's long con so her pocket can be picked.  <br /><br />The ad's association to therapy here was probably not planned but it was inevitable, just as Mantegna <i> selecting</i> a psychiatrist and not an engineer or a cook or a stripper as the mark in <i>House Of Games</i> was inevitable.  It is the only system of rules based on self-deception, it  encourages the illusion of "self" separate from behavior.  And as long as psychiatry uncritically elevates identity over behavior, it makes it-- not the patients, it-- an easy mark for con men with their own agenda: SSI, the justice system, gun control, schools, whatever.    "It's called a confidence game.  Why, because you give me your confidence?  No: because I give you mine."  Take a minute, think it through.<br /><br />Self esteem is sold to you as an inalienable right, not something to be earned; and if you don't have self-esteem it's because fake society made you feel bad about yourself.  But fake society also made you feel good about yourself, it propped you up.  The reason you got an A and not an R and believed it is because you actually believe you are an A kind of guy, Math, English, History, Science, PE, and Lunch notwithstanding.  A, not R.  But if everyone deserves it, it has no value.  Which is why getting  it is unsatisfying.  <br /><br />Self-esteem is relative, advertising knows this, which is why it operates on comparisons between you and the aspirational people in the ad that seem better because they own the product.  The Dove ad dispenses with the aspirational people and actually compares you to you.  But that's not you, it's aspirational you, "wouldn't it be great if people saw me in an idealized, sketchy kind of way?"   But even as it does this, it pretends self-esteem is innate.<br /><br />One of the great insights of psychoanalysis is that you never really want an object, you only want the wanting, which means the solution is to set your sights on an impossible ideal and work hard to reach it.  You won't.  That's not just okay, that's the point. It's ok if you fantasize about knowing kung fu if you then try to actually learn kung fu, eventually you will understand you can never really know kung fu, and then you will die.  And it will have been worth it.<br /><br />You can't see it, but since this is America, the problem here is debt.  Not credit card debt, though I suspect that's substantial too, but self-esteem debt.  They're borrowing against their future accomplishments to feel good about themselves today, hoping they'll be able to pay it back.  Melinda's 26, at that age some self-esteem debt is reasonable as long as you use it to hustle.  But what happens if you overspend now and can't pay it back by the time you're 40?  Look above.  Time for therapy or a moisturizing soap.  There's not enough quantitative easing in the universe to prop up this fantasy, but you can't say America's not committed to the attempt.<br /><br /><br /><br /><a href="http://twitter.com/thelastpsych">http://twitter.com/thelastpsych</a><br /><br /><br /><a href="http://thelastpsychiatrist.com/2011/11/luxury_branding_the_future_lea.html">Luxury Branding The Future Leaders Of The World</a><br /><br /></p>

        <![CDATA[<br /><br /><blockquote>Today in the United States and the developed world, women are better off than ever before. But the blunt truth is that men still run the world... <br /><br />It is time for us to face the fact that our revolution has stalled. A truly equal world would be one where women ran half of our countries and companies and men ran half of our homes. The laws of economics and many studies of diversity tell us that if we tapped the entire pool of human resources and talent, our performance would improve.<br /></blockquote><br /><br />I.<br /><br />Sheryl Sandberg is the future ex-COO of Facebook, and while that sounds like enough of a resume to speak on women in the workplace, note that her advice on how to get ahead appears in Time Magazine.&nbsp; Oh, you thought that Sandberg's book is news worthy in itself, how could you <i>not </i>do a story on this magnificence?&nbsp; No, this is a setup, the Time Magazine demo is never going to be COO of anything, as evidenced by the fact that they read Time Magazine.&nbsp; Much more importantly, they are not raising daughters who are going to be COO of anything.&nbsp; So why is this here?&nbsp; <br /><br />The first level breakdown is that this is what Time readers want, they want a warm glow and to be reassured that the reason they're stuck living in Central Time is sexism.&nbsp; This demo likes to see a smart, pretty woman succeed in a man's world, as long as "pretty" isn't too pretty but "wearing a great outfit" and that man's world isn't overly manly, like IBM or General Dynamics, yawn, but an aspirational, Aeron chair "creative" place that doesn't involve calculus or yelling, somewhere they suspect they could have worked had it not been for sexism and biological clocks.&nbsp; We all know Pinterest is for idiots.&nbsp; Hence Facebook.<br /><br /><br />II.<br /><br />If you are still suspicious that Sandberg's appearance in Time has nothing to do with her<i> book</i> or with women becoming COOs but is about <i>something else</i>, look through the newsstand for the other magazine in which Sandberg is prominently featured: <i>Cosmo</i>. &nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><div align="center"><img alt="cosmo sandberg.jpg" src="http://thelastpsychiatrist.com/images/cosmo%20sandberg.jpg" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" height="300" width="300" /><font style="font-size: 0.8em;">the first thing you noticed is her great outfit <br />and the first thing I noticed is she's showing her wedding ring</font><br /></div><br /><br /><br />This is the mag she felt compelled to <i>guest edit</i>, an issue that also has "The Money, The Man, The Baby: Get What You Want," by future Labor Secretary Kim Kardashian. No one reads Cosmo to become a COO, no one who reads Cosmo could become a COO, because-- and I'm just guessing-- they think the the secret formula for success is <i>Dream Job + The Right Partner + Great Wardrobe = Yes I Can!</i>&nbsp; Well, you 
can't, not with those priorities.&nbsp;&nbsp; Each of those may be desirable, but when placed together 
as an equation it is revealed to be nothing but outward branding, and 
the consequence is that even if you get all three you will still 
be unsatisfied.<br /><br />For the past two weeks Sandberg was anywhere nothing useful is happening, and I'm going to include Facebook in that.&nbsp; Some cry-baby over at <a href="http://jezebel.com/5990188/sheryl-sandberg-on-why-its-ok-to-cry-at-work">Jezebel</a> was thrilled that Sandberg was featured all week on <i>Access Hollywood</i>, holy Christ, she thought this was a good thing. "Feminism is back in the mainstream in a big way," she wrote, I assume in between quaaludes, "the women's movement is actually <i>moving</i>."&nbsp;&nbsp; How can you work in media and not understand media?&nbsp; The fact that feminism is in the mainstream means that <i>it doesn't exist</i>, it is no longer real, in the same way that when you hear "gun control debate" it's a lie and "fiscal cliff" is an easy to market, safe distraction from the structural problems that can never be named, here's one: for any heterogeneous population, the expansion of a "welfare class" is logically inseparable from the entrenchment of an aristocracy, can't have one without the other once you get bigger than 20M, ask Bismarck.&nbsp; "Does he write for Time?"&nbsp; No.&nbsp; But keep this in mind every time you hear how great it is Bill Gates is curing malaria after leaving us all with Windows.<br /><br />You might ask, well, how do we get women who read Cosmo and Jezebel 
to aspire to something greater?&nbsp; Your question is illogical.&nbsp; It's not because Cosmo and Jezebel attract dumb women, no, not exactly, it's that they <i>teach</i> their readers to 
want certain things over other things.&nbsp; <i>They teach them how to want.</i>&nbsp; What resists them?&nbsp; Nothing.&nbsp; Then who can unbrainwash them?&nbsp; No one.&nbsp; The person that should have was their mother, and they read Time.<br /><br /><br />III.<br /><br />But other than getting them to buy magazines, why bother with making women feel good about themselves?&nbsp;&nbsp; Are they going to riot because men won't let them be COOs?&nbsp; Placating the TV demographic 
whose only act of political violence was to Like the Kony video hardly seems urgently necessary.<br /><br />It's not to make them feel good, and it certainly isn't to inspire them to become COOs.&nbsp; It is what we drunks call "unconscious" and Sandberg herself is not aware of it.&nbsp; Don't equate what Sandberg wants with what the system wants to use her for.&nbsp; If they did not overlap, you would never know the name Sheryl Sandberg; or, said the other, more scary way, the only reason you know the name of Sheryl Sandberg is because it represents a defense against change.&nbsp; Off topic, not really, a short joke by comic Greg Giraldo: "It's so great that Americans will still vote for a white guy even if he's a little black."&nbsp; Defense against change.&nbsp; <br /><br />One of Sandberg's three Time-approved points is that women "leave before they leave," which means that instead of planning early to advance in their career, they plan early to leave their career.&nbsp;&nbsp; Here's a very revealing excerpt, read it closely:<br /><br /><blockquote>But women rarely make one big decision to leave the workforce. Instead, they make a lot of small decisions along the way. A law associate might decide not to shoot for partner because someday she hopes to have a family. A sales rep might take a smaller territory or not apply for a management role...<br /></blockquote><br />"So true!"&nbsp; Slow down.&nbsp; The trick is most employable women are at best at the "sales rep" level, not the lawyer level, but because of the juxtaposition you never think:&nbsp; why the hell would a sales rep <i>want</i> to be a manager? &nbsp; "Oh, because it's a lot more work."&nbsp; Is it a lot more money?&nbsp; "Well, no, it's a little more money."&nbsp; So you want me to work a lot more now for the possibility of eventually getting a job that pays only a little more money?&nbsp; "Yes, stupid, it's called a promotion."&nbsp; It sounds like a scam.&nbsp; "No, it's a stepping stone to Nominal Vice President In Charge of Situations And Scenarios."&nbsp; Does that pay more? &nbsp; "What are you, a communist?&nbsp; 401k matches 50% of the first 6%."&nbsp; In other words 3%, ok, am I on a prank show? &nbsp; "Free GPS tracker in your phone and laptop."&nbsp; Thank you Yaz, my forties are going to be great.<br /><br />Sandberg's book is heralded as "the next great feminist manifesto", by this logic the first one was TV Guide.&nbsp; Just because there's a woman near it, doesn't mean it's about women.&nbsp; The feminism debate, labeled equivalently as "gender discrimination" or "women sabotage themselves", is not about women, it is about LABOR COSTS, making working for something other than money admirable.&nbsp; If some women rise to COO that's unintended consequences, what the system really wants is people, especially the still not maxed out women, to <i>want</i> to work harder for it, to be a producer/consumer for it, by making noble and desirable the long hours, "a seat at the table"-- the kind of things that give away the majority of your high heeled, productive life in exchange for the trappings of power.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is one reason why while people think it's cool if Zuckerberg wears a hoodie, women's work attire is tightly controlled <i>by women</i>-- being <i>able </i>to dress up for work is signaled to you as part of the appeal of work, a perk, which is why every picture of Sandberg is in a "great outfit."&nbsp; It doesn't matter that Sandberg does or doesn't dress this way ordinarily, it only matters how her image can be repackaged to convey the correct message to you.&nbsp; Whatever Sandberg wants to say, whatever she thinks she means, is totally irrelevant to this process.&nbsp; The ability to run Facebook is insignificant next to the power of the Force.&nbsp; <br /><br />If you doubt this, observe that of all the advice Sandberg via Time gives to women, the single piece (in)conspicuously absent from the Time article is the most important: <i>ask for more money.</i>&nbsp; Duh.&nbsp; Ask for less hours.&nbsp; Ask for something real, that can affect your life, instead of the cosmetic, "trappings of power" gimmicks like titles or prestige-- the very things that would appeal most to a narcissistic culture obsessed with broadcasting identity, requiring not just external but <i>visible to others</i> validations of their worth.&nbsp; NB: it's not that Sandberg herself didn't say ask for more money-- she did, e.g. in her book and in the British "Americans are money hungry pigs" <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CD8QqQIwAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.guardian.co.uk%2Ftheguardian%2F2013%2Fmar%2F15%2Ffacebook-sheryl-sandberg-lean-in&amp;ei=4_dEUYGjJJfF4APL-YCwBQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNHE3HGiRiT3kGnXwkSsW4He5hZdqw">Guardian</a>.&nbsp; But that advice cannot appear in Time.&nbsp; What the Time article made a big deal about was that she <i>fought</i> for pregnancy parking spots, <i>that's</i> the progress, you go girl, Sandberg is also fighting for the right to cry at work, Jezebel was right, feminism is moving.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />Employers take note, Americans, especially American women, can be easily convinced to forgo money if it's not enough money to be flaunted or if something else can be.<br /><br />The same should apply to men, the difference is working men have an Act I backstory: two generations ago and back the whole game for men was the money, the lifestyle, the house/wife/car-- getting rich.&nbsp; I'm no fan of unions but they played it straight:&nbsp; if you're going to sacrifice your whole life and lower back for the benefit of a faceless corporation then you've got to get paid.&nbsp; But young, aspirational women can be convinced that working longer, "a seat at the table", "promotions" to management-- these are worthy goals: Sandberg said so.<br /><br />Just because my posts have lots of typos doesn't mean I'm lazy.&nbsp; I am not saying not to work hard, I am not saying not to run out the clock, I'm saying it has to be meaningful, it has to lead somewhere, it has to be for something, and if it doesn't then <i>at least</i> it has to pay.&nbsp; Amazingly on purpose, in the cacophony of economic debates, it's no longer acceptable to talk money.&nbsp; You can talk about unemployment vs. employment, class, titles, debt, growth, seats at table-- but not money, unless they are actors or sports stars.&nbsp; If I told you Katniss was making $10M or $90M you wouldn't know the difference, but try to get $1/hr more from your manager and you find out what a dollar is worth. "I'd like to see you take on more initiative," says your manager, "then maybe we can come up with some solutions that are right for both of us."&nbsp; I'm sorry, is a guy with a Blackberry and a Fox News app telling me I need to stay until 7 but I'm not worth $1/hr more? &nbsp; <br /><br />None of this has anything to do with feminism, stop saying that word, it's meaningless.&nbsp; This trick applies to men, too, let's go back to Zuckerberg and his hoodie: off of half a century of "the clothes make the man" and "don't dress for the job you have, dress for the job you want", the right to NOT have to get dressed up is sold to men as a perk, but look at the alchemy: it is 100% certain that if you think it's wicked that your job has casual everydays, then you are smart, get paid way less than you are worth and, most importantly, you will never dare ask for more money.&nbsp; Eventually dressing down will be sold as aspirational for women, but don't sweat it, wearing sneakers is a pro-feminist act, after all, they're made almost exclusively by women.<br /><br /><br /><br />IV.<br /><br />"Ladies, conference room in ten minutes!&nbsp; We need to strategize!"<br /><br /><br /><img alt="leanin.jpg" src="http://thelastpsychiatrist.com/images/leanin.jpg" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" height="278" width="500" /><br /><br /><br />This is a picture of a "Lean In," which I assume is why they're all wearing low cut tops.&nbsp; ZING. I can only imagine they are talking about the season finale of The Bachelor, because no legitimate business can be happening with blue pens and MacBook Pros, one of which isn't even open.&nbsp; Unless this is a PR meeting?&nbsp; HR?&nbsp; Erotica book club?&nbsp; I give up.&nbsp; Some other observations: pretty women love beverages and smiling.<br /><br />My personal vote for Lean In valedictorian is the woman at the bottom left, I don't know her life or her medication history but she has the diagnostic sign of her cuff pulled up over her wrist in what I call "the borderline sleeve," that girl will have endlessly whipsawing emotions and a lot of enthusiastic ideas that will ultimately result in a something borrowed/something blue.&nbsp; Hope her future ex enjoys drama, he's in for seven years of it.<br /><br />You're going to try and counter that this is a staged publicity photo, but my rum makes me fearless against your rebuttals.&nbsp; During my two months of radio silence I've been writing a book of/on pornography, so I know it when I see it, and I see it.&nbsp; Main thing to observe about this girl-girl feature: all the chicks are white.<br /><br />Back up, wildman, the easy criticism to make is that there are no blacks in the picture, which is why you made it.&nbsp; Everyone knows that the presence of blacks in such pics is staged, yet we still notice it, still want it.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp;&nbsp; Even though we roll our eyes if a black woman is artificially included in the pic, why are we still satisfied by her presence, or uncomfortable her absence?&nbsp; Because we have no power to change the underlying reality.&nbsp; "Better than nothing."&nbsp; <br /><br />This is a porno of a white woman's workplace, no room for blacks in this fantasy, they don't watch The Bachelor.&nbsp; Don't confuse aspirational with desirable, Halle Berry is ass-slappingly
 hot, no one wants to be her.&nbsp; "If I worked at a female-friendly place 
like Facebook," says anyone masturbating to this picture,&nbsp; "I'd totally 
have time to get my nails done."<br /><br />No, the insightful criticism isn't that they didn't artificially include a black woman, it is that they artificially excluded Asian women-- that this photo could only be made by <i>actively</i> <i>denying </i>a reality: among women, Asian women are proportionally overrepresented in successful positions, especially tech jobs, especially Silicon Valley, and yes, Apple Maps, India is in Asia.&nbsp; Putting this shot together is like staging an NBA publicity photo without any neck tattoos or handguns.&nbsp;&nbsp; "What?"&nbsp; When I was in my 3rd year of medical school and we all had to select our tax bracket, the Asian women went into surgery, ophthalmology, or the last two years of a PhD program, you know where the borderline sleeves went?&nbsp; Pediatrics, which I think is technically sublimation but I'm no psychiatrist.&nbsp; The logic was straightforward: they wanted&nbsp; kids, and, unlike surgery, pediatrics offered future doctor-moms a bit of flexibility, while the Asian women apparently didn't worry about working late because their kids would be at violin till 9:30.<br /><br />This porno, for the Time et al demographic, cannot allow this bit of reality to be shown, because the moment you see Padmakshi or "Megan" at the table it is <i>too real</i>,&nbsp; it undermines the entire sexism thesis and suggests that something else may be going on, it's like watching an awesome gangbang and suddenly noticing all the empty Oxycontin bottles and that they're speaking Serbian.&nbsp; "That just makes it hotter!"&nbsp; I just logged your ip address.&nbsp; This doesn't mean Asian women don't experience sexual discrimination, it means that when an Asian woman succeeds, the other women in the office don't get to experience sexual discrimination, so they're left only with sexual harassment.&nbsp; Read it a couple of times, it'll make sense and you won't like it. <br /><br />&nbsp; <br />V.<br /><br /><br />Still not sold on the thesis that the system wants you to be a battery?&nbsp; Then you're going to have a lot of trouble with this next part...... for the rest of your short life.<br /><br />The most important-- her words-- advice Sandberg has to offer 
women is... to choose your husband carefully.&nbsp;&nbsp; Think about this for a 
minute.&nbsp; I've fallen in love with some catastrophes in my life, I've drank a lot of rum, and I'm sure a lot of/all people say 
the same about me, but how on earth could I <i>choose</i> whom I fell in
 love with?&nbsp; The heart wants what it 
wants, even when what it wants is on Prozac.&nbsp;&nbsp; How could I select my 
love based on my career concerns, or is the logic that my soulless zombie
 skull would love anyone who agreed to do half the chores?&nbsp; The only 
person who can pull that off is a psychopath, and sure, you may indeed 
succeed in life, but at what cost?&nbsp; What are you good for?&nbsp; But the Time
 Magazine force vector doesn't care about your human happiness, it most 
certainly doesn't care about your caring about your partner's happiness,
 it cares about your role as producer, and by producer I mean consumer.&nbsp;
Eat up, it will have corn in it.&nbsp; <br /><br />Perhaps the logic is that I shouldn't <i>marry</i> anyone except one who is compatible with my goals, good advice-- except why, a priori, is one's middle management career at General Motors more important than one's marriage?<br /><br />"Half of all marriages end in divorce."&nbsp; Yes, stupid, everyone says that, half of all marriages under 25 end in divorce, but wait till thirty and the deck is way more favorable, you have to learn how to count cards.&nbsp; But this isn't some kind of failing of marriage itself, some structural&nbsp; defect in a system that's been running for thousands of years, the problem isn't marriage, the problem is you.&nbsp; You think the string of butcheries in your past are the fault of monogamy?&nbsp; As they say everywhere, the single commonality in all of your failed relationships is you.&nbsp; Time to get a cat.<br /><br />"No, she just means when you get married, to pick someone who supports your goals."&nbsp; In other words, a business relationship?&nbsp; Arranged marriage, only this time by Match.com's algorithm?&nbsp; "No, a marriage based not on passion but on mutual respect and shared values--" Stop, listen to what you are saying.&nbsp; Why would you want a man who agreed to this?&nbsp; <i>Why would a man want a woman who thought like this?</i><br /><br />Keep in mind, her message is not for future COOs, her message is for the rest of you organ donors who need to be transitioned from 9 to 5 to 8 to 6, e.g. the Cosmo demo.&nbsp; The Time Magazine demo already gave up on love, after a decade and a half of a narcissistic marriage they only need to be convinced to work Saturdays or spend more.&nbsp; Either will do. <br /><br />The single greatest obstacle to turning women into fully productive members of the workforce, i.e. batteries, is not men obstructing them but their persistent belief in metaphysics. If the thing that is keeping women out of the underpaid labor force is "family", then family must go, and if what pulls them towards family is love then love has to be a fantasy.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />I know what you're thinking.&nbsp; You're worldly, you're cynical, your skeptical. You don't go for all this love crap....&nbsp; You've figured out that love was a 
construct pushed by the patriarchy to keep women tied to the home, to deny them orgasms with multiple penises and vaginas; to prevent 
them from getting jobs, money, power.&nbsp; Am I right?&nbsp; Ok, then let's play by your rules, let's 
say you're right that love was used to keep women down-- then what does today's suppression of love signify?&nbsp; Could it be that the abandonment of love doesn't also serve the system's purpose?&nbsp;
 Or is only the former the trick, the latter a discovery made by your genius + 
sophistication + expert reading of human emotions?<br /><br />You think you've figured out that true love doesn't 
exist, that it's all been a kind of romantic lie sold by TV and the media, that real 
life isn't like that; 
but what I am telling you is that you 
didn't <i>figure </i>this out, you were TOLD this.&nbsp; Now, constantly, by every modern
 TV show, by Lori Gottlieb and the zombies at The Atlantic, by your friends, by 
your parents-- the trick was to get you to think you figured it out on 
your own.&nbsp; Grey's Anatomy is a terrible show but at least season one had the 
decency to be about having careless sex along the road to finding The One.&nbsp;
 You know where their passions lie now?&nbsp; Running a hospital.&nbsp; Yesterday's episode featured eleven minutes of two young, superhot doctors orgasming over the new X-ray machine and how great it is for both efficiency and patient care, it's almost as if the Disney Corp is doing its part to 
convince America that hospitals aren't in it for the money, they're warm and fuzzy places that are committed to helping patients with their fertility.<br /><br />The system's ideal woman is the single mother, she's produced with her 
uterus and is willing to go all in on production/consumption, she has no
 choice.&nbsp; I'm not saying she wants to be a single mother, I'm 
saying that's what the system wants her to be.&nbsp; That's feminism. You can get married 
too, as long as he'll make it so you get in at 8.<br /><br />Unfortunately-- and this is exactly the trick of it all-- it sounds crazy to say, "wait for true love!"-- it sounds regressive to say that pushing yourself at work might not be 
worth trading your family, but that's the trick, the system has framed 
that question as binary, as if there were no other possibilities, no middle ground.&nbsp; The system 
has made it so that you can only choose one side, "aspire to be a COO!" or "don't be a COO-- you should be home with your kids!"&nbsp; It is a classic double 
bind, and you can't ask: for the entirety of my life, these are the only two choices?&nbsp; <br /><br />Love is dying, the system is killing it.&nbsp; The only 
acceptable portrayal of fulfilled love is with vampires and BDSM billionaires, not
 because those men are great but because there's no worry you'll meet one, enjoy your little fantasy.&nbsp; Now back to 
work, whore, you need fulfillment.<br /><br /><br />]]>

<div><br /></div>]]>
        <![CDATA[<br /><div>For some reason, one of the most emailed articles from the NYT was an article about <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2013/01/02/does-makeup-hurt-self-esteem">whether women should</a> or should not wear make up.&nbsp; "New York Times? Sounds progressive."&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; <br /><br />Seven
 people were asked their opinion in a column called "Room For Debate," 
liars, there was no debate, all of them said "I guess so", their main 
contribution was the hedge: "it's a woman's choice."&nbsp; So while 
pretending this was some kind of debate with contrasting opinions, all 
of them had the same opinion, which should automatically signal to you 
it is the wrong one.<br /><br />When they say, "it's a woman's choice" what 
they mean is "it's not a man's choice, it is thoroughly stupid to wear 
make up just for men, the only acceptable reason is if you do it for 
yourself, if it makes you feel better about yourself."<br /><br />Let me 
offer a contrary position, unpalatable but worth considering: the only appropriate time to 
wear make up is to look attractive to men.&nbsp;&nbsp; Or women, depending on which 
genitals you want to lick, hopefully it's both.&nbsp; "Ugh, women are not 
objects."&nbsp; Then why are you painting them?&nbsp; I'm not saying you <i>have </i>to
 look good for men, I'm saying that if wearing makeup not for men makes 
you feel better about yourself, you don't have a strong self, and no, 
yelling won't change this.&nbsp; Everyone knows you shouldn't judge a book by
 its cover, now you're saying the cover of the book influences how the 
book feels about itself? <br /><br />I am not doubting that in fact you <i>do</i>
 feel better about yourself, I am saying that that fact is both 
pathological and totally on purpose.&nbsp; Since this cognitive
 trick does help you feel better about yourself, by all means go ahead,&nbsp;
 but at what point will you stop pressuring other women to go along with
 it?&nbsp; When will you stop "requiring" it, like when you say, "oh, she's 
so pretty even without makeup" as if the default was makeup?<br /><br />The fraud women now believe is that it is wrong to look good for men <i>only</i>, as an end in itself; the progressive delusion is that looking 
good for men is synonymous with submissiveness, so while you're allowed to look good <i>to</i> men, it should always be secondary to looking good for yourself.&nbsp; This is madness.&nbsp; You are enhancing your
 outward appearance, which is great, but then you pretend it's
 for internal reasons? &nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />How would you like to 
live in a world where men had to wear make up?&nbsp; "Oh, I love make up on a
 guy, especially eyeliner."&nbsp; Of course you do, you're having a stroke.&nbsp; 
Ask it this way: how would you like to be in a world where men said," 
oh, I feel so much better about myself when I'm wearing makeup."&nbsp; You'd 
run for the nearest totalitarian regime.<br /><br />The trick to the makeup 
debate is that it pretends to want to be free of male pressure, yet the pressure
 to look a certain way is actually much worse from women.&nbsp; So this result
 is that a&nbsp; "patriarchical", controlling
 force, unacceptable if coming directly from men, is maintained by 
giving the whip to other women.&nbsp; No boss man would survive if he said, 
"ugh, you should put on some makeup, doll yourself up a little bit" but 
women say this to other women all the time-- especially at work.&nbsp; "You 
look really tired," says a woman in MAC Greensmoke to another who 
isn't.&nbsp; Just once I wish the reply would be, "I am, your husband kept me
 up all night."&nbsp; Not very progressive, but hilarious.&nbsp; <br /><br />The evolution from "enhances sexual attractiveness" to "doing it for yourself" is definitely a regressive step, and by regressive I here mean "regressing to age two", but it's the next step which reveals the presence of a neurosis: recruiting science as a <i>justification </i>for behavior: "<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/10/14/makeup-tips-women-workplace_n_1010523.html">Study finds makeup makes you appear more competent</a>."&nbsp; Can't wait to read about that study in a Jonah Lehrer book.&nbsp; Ugh.&nbsp; So here's the evolution of feminist theory, take notes: "I want to look better" to "I want to feel better about myself" to "I want people to think I am better."&nbsp; Madness.&nbsp; <br /><br />The further clue that the problem is not gender but... you... is that you find this pseudoscience while you are browsing the internet, i.e. it is your entertainment, your free time; your <i>leisure time</i> is spent justifying a behavior you can't not do.&nbsp; "But I wasn't looking for those articles, I just stumbled on them."&nbsp; Exactly. <br /><br />The
 reason the makeup debate is insoluble is that it's not yours to solute.
 The choice to wear makeup is no choice at all, I know you think you 
came to it on your own but you live in America, you don't make free choices here, freedom is a brand.&nbsp; Makeup is an $8B/yr industry, that's face makeup alone, 
no way is it going to allow you to make a choice that doesn't involve a 
credit card, fine, if you don't like makeup here's a remover for $30, 
just remember that you're not doing it for men, you're doing it for 
yourself.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />II.<br /><br />I had used all the porn on the internet, so I turn on the TV, and there's a marionette called Diane Sawyer interviewing 20 
female Senators, the most in history, applauding and giggling as if cold fusion had finally been
 discovered.&nbsp; Of course it's a "good thing" that women are Senators in 
as much as not <i>allowing </i>them to be Senators is the bad thing, but
 other than that, what does it mean?&nbsp; That women are finally brave 
enough to run, or America is brave enough to hire them?&nbsp; It's not like 
the Capitol Building was turning them away, so why is this important?&nbsp; I knew I 
was 
being scammed because I was being told this was a historic 
accomplishment by the ABC Network.&nbsp; The ABC demo is 
not ever going to be a Senator, I would bet ten bazillion dollars they 
couldn't even name one of their Senators and a gazillion bazillion 
dollars they have no real idea what Senators do, so why is this on prime time ABC?&nbsp;
 <br /><br />I think the answer is supposed to be, "it's empowering to 
women", but you should wonder: when more women enter a field, it means 
less men did, and if the men stopped going there, where did they go?&nbsp; 
Why did they leave?&nbsp; I assume they aren't home with the kids, right?<br /><br />I
 don't want to be cynical, but boy oh boy is it hard not to observe that
 at the very moment in our history when we have the most women in the 
Senate, Congress is perceived to be pathetic, bickering, easily manipulated and 
powerless, and I'll risk the blowback and say that those are all 
stereotypes of women.&nbsp; Easy, HuffPo, I know it's not causal, I am saying
 the reverse: that if some field keeps the trappings of power but loses 
actual power, women enter it in droves and men abandon it like the 
Roanoke Colony.&nbsp; Again we must ask the question: if power seeking men 
aren't running for Senate, where did they go?&nbsp; Meanwhile all the 
lobbyists and Wall Street bankers are men, isn't that odd?&nbsp; "Women 
aren't as corrupt or money hungry."&nbsp; Yes, that's been my experience with
 women as well.<br /><br />This works in reverse, too, take a field 
traditionally XX-only, like nursing, and, huh, what do you know-- at 
the time where nursing is more powerful than it has ever been, there are
 also more XY in it than ever.&nbsp; But who made it more powerful?&nbsp; <i>It wasn't nurses</i>.&nbsp; And if you're playing that game, ask if the reason "sexy nurses" as a fetish dropped out somewhere around the 90s had nothing to do with females finally getting control over their sexualization but exactly the opposite, men came in and unsexualized the joint.&nbsp; "I'm not gay."&nbsp; Easy, Focker, no one was implying anything.&nbsp; <br /><br />I know to a woman it must feel good, "yay, I'm a Senator!" and I do not minimize the <i>individual</i>
 accomplishment of a woman becoming a Senator.&nbsp; But for everyone else, 
what is the significance?&nbsp; One of the Yay-Women senators suggested that 
the government would benefit from all the makeup because "<a href="http://politicker.com/2013/01/women-in-the-senate-explain-why-they-do-it-better/">women's styles tend to be more collaborative</a>," and at the exact same moment she repeated the conventional wisdom's horrendous banality she simultaneously got married to the <a href="http://www.pressherald.com/life/Maine-Sen-Susan-Collins-weds-in-low-key-ceremony-.html">head of a lobbying firm</a>.&nbsp; That's progress, I guess.<br /><br />The
 problem isn't with women in the Senate, but rather its celebration, 
which these dummies blindly participate in.&nbsp; Is it putting on a face for
 the American public, the way the first face I see on Goldman Sachs's 
website is a black woman? &nbsp; Is it <i>cosmetic?</i>&nbsp; She's probably 
proud, she should be proud, that she made it to GS, but for the rest of 
blacks and women, what is the significance?&nbsp; It may be regressive to ask this, but it is illuminating: "hey.... why did they let so many of us in?" <br />&nbsp; <br />This is part of a 
larger, systemic problem with the way power has shifted not from Group A to Group B, but from ground up to top down, and top down works in a very specific way: it concedes the trappings of power while it retains the actual power. &nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />III.<br /><br />In this case, you are seeing a shift of power be repackaged as a gender battle.&nbsp; And it's quite apparent that power is a generation or so ahead of you, so in 1990 a 40 year old who grew up around successful lawyers then says to his 5 year old, "daughter, you should become a lawyer!" and she probably at one point collaborates to decry the lack of female role models, and then by the time she graduates law school she discovers she's a dime a dozen, power has been withdrawn, one step ahead; and at this rate I fully expect 2013's Aspirational 14% to nudge their 5 year old daughters towards investment banking so they can be part of the big Women In Investment Banking conference of 2033.&nbsp; Don't bother, it'll be in Newark.<br /><br />I can't predict the next field of power, I'm happy to hear your projections, the point for now is that while power moves ahead of you and your family, it leaves behind the appearance of a gender (or racial) struggle; and the immediate result of this is that people consider it a societal achievement that they are merely playing, even if what they are doing is ultimately meaningless.&nbsp; So while women (appropriately) fought for, and got, equal access to college educations-- and now women even outnumber men in colleges-- today we find that college is irrelevant.&nbsp; Huh. &nbsp; NB: what women did not fight for, and this is to my point, is the specific power of being taken seriously <i>without </i>a college education. "But how will the world know we're equal?"<br /><br />The focus here, again, is why did/do women fight so much for what became irrelevant?&nbsp; Why does this happen all the time?&nbsp; More specifically, did they pursue it because they thought it had power, or did they pursue it because it had the trappings of power?&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm not being a jerk, it is a deadly serious question.&nbsp; If some dentist fires his hygenist because she's too pretty the United States Of America goes to Defcon 1, but if Goldman Sachs doesn't hire enough women some idiot at <i>The Atlantic</i> writes a fluff piece.&nbsp; "They apparently have a sexist culture there."&nbsp; You know they rule the world, right?&nbsp; <br /><br />I know, I know, women get paid less then men.&nbsp; Sigh.&nbsp; There are a 
million reasons for this, but the most important is the simplest: some people want to get more money from the job, and some other people want the job to offer 
them more money, and they are not the same people.&nbsp; Typically the former is men and the latter is women, but the point isn't gender but the mindset: the latter group wants <i>the job</i> to <i>want </i>to pay them more, they don't want to have to have any input in deciding their own reimbursement.&nbsp; I have this conversation with women a lot, every time it goes exactly like this: <br /><br /><br />Her: They only offered me $X. <br />Me: Why didn't you ask for more?&nbsp; <br />Her: I don't know... I was just happy to get the job.<br /><br />And I throw up my hands, nothing I say will convince this senator to try harder for herself.&nbsp; I have this same conversation with men as well, less frequently but not never, though the conversation is slightly different:<br /><br />Him: They only offered me $X.<br />Me: Why didn't you ask for more?&nbsp; <br />Him: I don't know... I was just happy to get the job.&nbsp; <br />Me: What are you, a girl?<br /><br /><br />Works every time.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />IV.<br /><br />Everything you need to know about how the system sees you is expressed in its purest way in ads.&nbsp; So, completely off topic, here's an ad, relax, this has nothing to do with guns:<br /><br /><br /><br /><img alt="bushmaster ad.jpg" src="http://thelastpsychiatrist.com/images/bushmaster%20ad.jpg" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" height="439" width="327" /><br /><br /><br /><br />I
 had never seen this ad, because the ad was not for me. The ad targets 
men who need a gun to feel like a real man, the gun validates their masculinity-- or so the ordinary, pseudo-feminist 
deconstruction would go. &nbsp;&nbsp; Except that's not what the ad says.&nbsp; It says, quite clearly, that the highest validator of masculinity isn't the 
gun, it is the <i>card</i>.&nbsp; <br /><br />You've been trained to look at these things in terms of gender, forget it, the pathology of the generation is narcissism, the ad 
knows about, and works only on, a society eyeballs deep in narcissism, that requires its 
identity broadcast by branded objects but validated by other people.&nbsp; 
Because what this ad says, explicitly, is that owning the gun doesn't make you a man; <i>when you own the gun, some other omnipotent entity will declare you a man.</i>&nbsp; <br /><br />I'm not saying that gun owners need to show their guns off, I'm saying this ad assumes that.&nbsp; There was a time where merely <i>possessing </i>the fetishized object was enough to self-identify ("I'm awesome, I'm having sex with a blonde"; "just having my 9mm inside my jacket makes me feel bad ass"), but this is no longer sufficient, it is no longer powerful enough to penetrate your thick skull, you have to be able to show it to someone else, to watch their eyes light up in recognition for you to know <i>you have convinced them of who you are</i>.&nbsp; <br /><br />Is it cosmetic?&nbsp; Note the logic has evolved from "you'll feel better about yourself" to "other people will see you as more competent."<br /><br />Forget about the gun/masculinity interaction, it is a red herring; the problem is the cycle of wanting outsiders to tell you who you are, which is why empty celebrity works just as well as accomplished celebrity, which is why you can't tell if Kanye West is downgrading to Kim Kardashian or she is downgrading to him. <br /><br />But right on cue, the most deluded of women, not just a feminist but a self-proclaimed "feminist evangelist," showed up and completely missed the point, so she changed what was a clear example of the generational pathology of narcissism, and repackaged it as a gender issue:<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><img alt="valenti bushmaster.JPG" src="http://thelastpsychiatrist.com/images/valenti%20bushmaster.JPG" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" height="439" width="459" /><br /><br /><br /><br />"We?"&nbsp; As in, "we at Feministing?"<br /><br />If
 you follow that the 
consumer unconsciously understands that his masculinity is approved from 
the outside, by other people, then Valenti is the very person that the 
ad is arguing against: "these bitches think you're not a man.&nbsp; We at Busmaster tell 
you differently.&nbsp; Who are you going to believe?"&nbsp; Hell, I'lI believe a 
Sleestak before I listen to Jessica Valenti, really, those are my only two choices? The ad had no effect on me; her tweet makes me want to join a militia.<br /><br />Note
 she doesn't really want to discuss it, she assumes it's self-explanatory, as if the very fact that masculinity and guns are related is itself bad, as if the solution was to uncouple the 
two.&nbsp; But what would happen next?&nbsp; The problem, as above, isn't the gun 
but the need for external validation, which means if you take the gun 
away something else must replace it, and it won't be what works for her, e.g. exposed brick and that great show <i>Girls</i>.&nbsp; "It's great!"&nbsp; It's 
horrendous.&nbsp; <br /><br />V.<br /><br />To understand exactly why "feminism" or 
whatever Valenti thinks she has re-invented has not only stalled, but is damaging to all humanity, all you need to do is go to the source.&nbsp; Totally at random, I went to <i>Huffington Post Women</i>.&nbsp; Let's see what the feminists are up to, here are the top five articles: <br /><br />1. <i>The Reason The Academy Passed On Kathryn Bigelow</i> (answer: sexism.)<br /><br />2. <i>Confessions Of A Mistress</i> (protip: "Here's the wisdom I can offer to mistresses out there: do not get too attached.")<br /><br />3. <i>Why You Should Be Nervous-- And Yet Not-- About Sunday Night</i> (since the Golden Globes conflict with <i>Girls</i>, just DVR <i>Girls</i>, and anyway Lena Dunham will be at the Globes.)<br /><br />4. <i>'Girls' Star Talks Nudity And Season 2</i> (I refused to even click it)<br /><br />5. <i>Meet The Woman Who's Only Eating From Starbucks</i><br /><br /><br />Look, it's easy to make fun of these articles, my point isn't that sometimes women read nonsense.&nbsp; The point here is that they are <i>branded </i>as for women, this is what the <i>Huffington Post Women</i> thinks of women, they suspect, apparently rightly, that women will respond better to these articles if they are told they are "For Women."<br /><br />Here's a quote from #5, the woman who is eating Starbucks for a year:<br /><br /><blockquote>So how can eating only one company's products impact me, anybody? Well 
Mr. McDonald's already proved that question years ago with his 
documentary and Mr. Subway did his take on the loosing weight portion of
 the food challenges too. But when I watched those guys doing their 
thing I asked myself "where are the WOMEN challenging themselves in the 
world?" "Where are the effects being shown on a woman's culture? A 
woman's family &amp; children? A woman's diet, weight, fashion, 
checkbook, community and world through challenges?" "Where is HER VOICE 
on how an international company is directly or indirectly impacting 
everything from her waistline to her bottom line and every other 
woman's, man's, child's, societies and planets world with their 
presence?"<br /></blockquote><br /><br />What's 
crazy about this crazy person is that she's crazy, if she did this in 
the name of her own psychopathology we could happily ignore her, but she's doing this <i>for</i> women, she's saying it's for women, when what you want to say is, "you know this makes 
people hate women, right?"&nbsp; Mr. McDonalds didn't do
 it for men, or even as a man, he just did it, why do you have to drag 
the rest of the women into your delusions? <br /><br />But this is the kind of solidarity popularized by <a href="http://thelastpsychiatrist.com/2011/06/is_the_cult_of_self-esteem_rui.html">Lori Gottlieb</a> and the rest-- and I am asking, at what expense?&nbsp; Sites like Jezebel and Feministing are much, much worse than pornography, every article they write sets women back a week, do the math, they do such a disservice to women because they take their narcissism and repackage it as gender issues, and you're locked into it.&nbsp; What if I don't think gun control is a gender issue?&nbsp; What if watching Girls makes me want to make a snuff film?&nbsp; To use your impossible language, "where is my safe space to challenge your privilege?"<br /><br />My point isn't that women don't have legitimate gripes with the system, or that there isn't sexism still around, my point is that most of what you think is "feminism" is really a work, a gimmick, a marketing scheme.&nbsp; It is straight up consumerism, repackaged as a gender issue.&nbsp; Case in point: season 1 and 2 of <i>Girls</i>.<br /><br />And most importantly of all: if this is what women's solidarity is made of, how much support can they really expect from each other?&nbsp; Is this solidarity power, or the trappings of power?&nbsp; "Did you see Girls last night?"&nbsp; No, I'm sorry, I was being raped.&nbsp; "Oh, too bad.&nbsp; It was a good one."<br /><br /><br />VI.<br /><br />In <i>Django Unchained</i>,
 evil slaveowner Leonardo DiCaprio asks a question.&nbsp; Sorry, back up: why
 does everyone call him an evil slaveowner?&nbsp; As far as I can tell, he 
was a pretty average slaveowner, I'd even say he was "kind", in the 
sense that all his slaves "like" him, and he rarely "tortures" anyone 
and by the use of quotes you can see I'm hedging, my point here is how 
quickly people have to broadcast &nbsp;their indignancy.&nbsp; "He's evil."&nbsp; 
So what you're saying is you're against slavery?&nbsp; Thanks for clarifying.<br /><br />This
 explains the near-universal anxiety over the movie's frequent use of the 
word nigger, and someone asked Tarantino if he thought he had used it 
too much in the movie, and his response was perfect: "too much, in 
comparison to how much it was used back then?"&nbsp; Nigger, and the 
violence, was all anyone was upset about.&nbsp; Terry Gross, NPR's mental Fleshlight, asked Tarantino her typically insightful 
and nuanced questions: "do you enjoy violent movies less after what 
happened at Sandy Hook?"&nbsp; Sigh.&nbsp; So there's the Terry Gross checklist 
for reviewing <i>Django</i>: gun=bad and saying nigger=bad.&nbsp; Check and 
check.&nbsp; You know what no one thought badworthy?&nbsp; When the white guy 
asked to have a certain slave sent to his room to try out her ample vagina, 
and the prim white lady of the house happily escorted her up.&nbsp; "Go on, do 
what you're told, girl."<br /><br />I'd venture that Terry Gross and and the gang at HuffPoWo would rather be whipped than be-- that's rape, right?-- but 
that scene didn't light up their amygdalas, only hearing "nigger" did.&nbsp; I
 find that highly suspicious, or astoundingly obtuse, or both.<br /><br />Anyway,
 perfectly ordinary slaveowner DiCaprio asks a rhetorical question, a 
fundamental question, that has occurred to every 7th grade white boy and
 about 10% of 7th grade white girls, and the profound 
question he asked was: "<i>Why don't they just rise up?</i>"<br /><br />Kneel down, Quentin
 Tarantino is a genius.&nbsp; That question should properly come from the 
mouth of the German dentist: this isn't his country, he doesn't really 
have an instinctive feel for the system, so it's completely legitimate 
for a guy who doesn't know <i>the score</i> to ask this question, which 
is why 7th grade boys ask it; they themselves haven't yet felt the crushing 
weight of the system, so immediately you should ask, how early have 
girls been crushed that they don't think to ask this? &nbsp; But Tarantino puts this question in the mouth of the power, it is spoken by the 
very lips of that system; because of course the reason they don't rise 
up is that he-- that system-- <i>taught them not to</i>.&nbsp; When the system tells you what to do, you have no choice but to obey.<br /><br />If "the system tells you what to do" doesn't seem very compelling, remember that the movie you are watching is <i>Django UNCHAINED</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 Why did Django rise up?&nbsp; He went from whipped slave to stylish gunman 
in 15 minutes.&nbsp; How come Django was so quickly freed not just from 
physical slavery, but from the 40 years of repeated psychological 
oppression that still keeps every other slave in self-check?&nbsp; Did he swallow the Red Pill? How did he
 suddenly acquire the emotional courage to kill white people?&nbsp; <br /><br />"The
 dentist freed him."&nbsp; So?&nbsp; Lots of free blacks in the South, no 
uprisings.&nbsp; "He's 'one in ten thousand'?"&nbsp; Everybody is 1 in 10000, 
check a chart.&nbsp; "He got a gun?"&nbsp; Doesn't help, even today there are gun 
owners all over America who feel that they aren't free.&nbsp; No.&nbsp; You should
 read this next sentence, get yourself a drink, and consider your own 
slavery: <i>the system told Django that he was allowed to</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp; He was 
given a document that said he was a bounty hunter, and as an agent of 
the system, he was allowed to kill white people.&nbsp; That his new job 
happened to coincide with the trappings of power is 100% an accident, 
the system decided what he was worth and what he could do with his life<i>.</i>&nbsp;
 His powers were on loan, he wasn't even a vassal, he was a tool.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />This is not to minimize the <i>individual</i> accomplishment of a Django becoming a free man.&nbsp; But for the other slaves, what is the significance? <br /><br />Of course Tarantino knew that the evil slaveowner's question has a hidden, repressed dark side:&nbsp; DiCaprio is a third generation slave owner, he doesn't own slaves because he hates blacks, he owns them because that's the system; so powerful is that system that he spends his <i>free time</i> not on coke or hookers but on researching scientific justifications for the slavery-- trying to rationalize what he is doing. &nbsp; That is not the behavior of a man at peace with himself, regardless of how much he thinks he likes white cake, it is the behavior of a man in conflict, who suspects he is not free; who realizes, somehow, that the fact that his job happens to coincide with the trappings of power is 100% an accident... do you see?&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why don't they just rise up?" is revealed to be a symptom of the question that has been repressed: "<i>why do the whites own slaves?&nbsp; Why don't they just... stop?</i>"&nbsp; And it never occurs to 7th graders to ask this question because they are too young, yet every adult thinks if he lived back then, he would have been the exception.&nbsp; 1 in 10000, I guess.&nbsp; And here we see how repression always leaves behind a signal of what's been repressed-- how else do you explain the modern need to add the qualifier "evil" to "slaveowner" if not for the deeply buried suspicion that, in fact, you would have been a slaveowner back then?&nbsp; "But at least I wouldn't be evil."&nbsp; Keep telling yourself that.&nbsp; And if some guy in a Tardis showed up and asked, what's 
up with you and all the slaves, seems like a lot?&nbsp; You'd say what 
everybody says, "look wildman, don't ask me, that's just the system.&nbsp; Can't 
change it.&nbsp; Want to rape a black chick?"<br /><br /><br /><br />IV.<br /><br />Speaking
 of no one being upset about rape, here's a story, starts out bad and gets even worse in ways you won't expect: a 16 year old girl is
 passed out drunk at a party, she is then allegedly raped by a/two high 
school football players, and carried unconscious to other parties and 
displayed and/or raped, and apparently because the town has a "football 
culture" no arrests are made, it's hushed up, the boys are protected, 
and I think to myself, oh, that's weird, is that town still in 1986?&nbsp; 
True story: in 1986, at a mixer at the Delta Gamma sorority house, Lacoste 
Football Guy gets hard for 16 year old sister of Benetton Girl,
 and in order to get her jeans off he hits her in the head with a lamp, so in order to keep her 
jeans on 
she kicks him in the mouth, and through the blood and fury 
he's screaming he'll sue her, <i>do you know who my father is?</i>&nbsp; NB: he went on to become a lawyer and no I am not making that up.<br /><br />"Ugh,
 even now, 25 years later, it's still a hypermasculine rape culture."&nbsp; 
Ha!&nbsp; No.&nbsp; Hypermasculine?&nbsp; Where are you, the Dominican?&nbsp; No, what's amazing/obvious is how
 after 25 years of Diane Sawyer and makeup debates, <i>not one other girl 
at this party came to the victim's aid</i>; not one girl saw what was happening at 
the party and simultaneously called 911 and Facetimed the crime; not one
 girl called all the women she knew and brought the wrath of Athena down
 on that town.&nbsp; Nope.&nbsp; Nothing. &nbsp; A lot of laughing and giggling though,
 turns out rape is funny, someone owes Daniel Tosh a huge 
apology.&nbsp; "Women's styles tend to be more collaborative."&nbsp; I can tell, 
they collaborated to keep their mouth shut.&nbsp; In 1986 the sorority girls 
also collaborated to blame the victim for for being so rough with 
Lacoste Guy:&nbsp; "How could you do that to him?&nbsp; His face is like, totally 
corroded."&nbsp; Hey, come on, look how he was dressed, he was asking for it.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />"We need more women in power." Wrong preposition, dummy, 
but anyway you have them.&nbsp; You have judges and prosecutors and twenty 
female senators, what has it gotten you?&nbsp; Your own ground floor women don't 
protect each other, you know who had to come to this teen's aid?&nbsp; 
Anonymous.&nbsp; <i>Men</i>.<br />&nbsp;<br />Of course I don't know if the boys really did these things or not, ok?&nbsp; But if the reason the boys were protected 
was the "football culture," that means people in the town were taught to
 protect them.&nbsp; And if the girls did nothing, it means they were taught 
to do nothing, and the people most responsible for that lesson was other women. <br /><br />"No, the 
town was corrupt, they swept these kinds of things under the rug for 
years."&nbsp; If you've known for years the town isn't going to help women, if 
you've known for years it's a "hypermasculine rape culture,"&nbsp; wouldn't 
that make women want to stick together more?<br /><br />It's not like these teen girls were denied an education or had to endure sexual harrassment at work or had to go to Sweden to get abortions, if there was ever a generation that should feel most empowered it would be them, yet they-- not just one of them; all of them-- "knew", somehow, that they could/should do nothing.&nbsp; Which means that they were taught that from somewhere, and the only place that it could have come was older women.&nbsp; "The other lesson is: makeup is a choice."&nbsp; Today I learned nothing. <br /><br />There's your 
female empowerment, there's you feminist progress, catastrophically 
subverted from the top down, like it's in an abusive relationship, 
satisfied with the house and the car and the 4/7 good days and simply doesn't want to 
rock the boat so it expends frantic energy on what is ultimately nonsense.&nbsp;&nbsp; Every stupid parent teaches their girls not to get 
raped, duh, but have any mothers spent any time indoctrinating their 
daughters what to do if <i>another </i>woman is being raped?&nbsp; Have they made it a <i>reflex</i>
 to defend, to attack?&nbsp; "Isn't that obvious?"&nbsp; Ask the town.&nbsp; "We need to support each other!" sure, as long 
as it's from the safety of a computer monitor or a 5K, yay women.&nbsp; Have 
you explicitly told your daughters that if a woman is passed out drunk 
and you see a Notre Dame Hat climbing over her couch, <i>it is your responsibility</i> to grab an aerosol
 can and a lighter and threaten Armageddon, <i>or at the very least yell stop?</i>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, that's kind of dangerous."&nbsp; Yeah, that's kind of the point, 
but I grant you that it's safer to giggle and let boys be boys.&nbsp; Do you want power, or the 
trappings of power?&nbsp; Somebody's going to have it, you can't make it 
vanish.&nbsp; I wasn't at this particular rape, the town's defense amazingly 
appears to be she was a slut and she was asking for it, and my point is:
 so what?&nbsp; Why didn't the other women stop it anyway?&nbsp; <i>Why didn't they just rise up?</i><br /><br /><br /><a href="http://twitter.com/thelastpsych">http://twitter.com/thelastpsych</a><br /><br /><br /></div><div><br /></div>]]>

        <![CDATA[<a href="http://thelastpsychiatrist.com/2012/11/hipsters_on_food_stamps_part_2.html">Part 2 here</a><br /><br />Three questions, open book:<br /><br />1.&nbsp; Did <a href="http://thelastpsychiatrist.com/2012/11/hipsters_on_food_stamps.html">Hipster Gerry</a> get his money's worth from the University of Chicago, either $100k in future income or knowledge?&nbsp; No.<br /><br />2. Did society get their money's worth in sending him, i.e. by permitting/facilitating the diversion of his intellect into whatever it was he majored in?&nbsp; No.<br /><br />Neither of those questions have the force to change reality.&nbsp; This one does:<br /><br />3. Did the University of Chicago get their money's worth out of him, was $100k worth the dilution to their brand?&nbsp;&nbsp; No.<br /><br />Universities are going to need to differentiate themselves as something more than a processing plant for future consumers of Chinese textiles, local produce, and California&nbsp; pornography.&nbsp; But that time is a long, long way off.&nbsp; What can universities do in the meantime, to keep up their brand in the face of thousands of product recalls every year?<br />&nbsp;<br />Time for the go team: The New York Times.<br /><br /><br />II.<br /><br />The NYT has <a href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/17/how-to-live-without-irony/">an article</a> criticizing hipsters.&nbsp; How much would you pay for such an article?&nbsp; (NB: you paid zero for mine.)&nbsp; That's a legit question, not "you get what you pay for."&nbsp; Ten cents?&nbsp; A dollar?&nbsp; Remember that figure, we'll come back to it.<br /><br />This is how the article begins:<br /><br /><blockquote>If irony is the ethos of our age -- and it is -- then the hipster is our archetype of ironic living.<br /></blockquote><br />If your reservoir for archetypes goes back only one generation, you need your eyeball scanned, you're probably a replicant.&nbsp; Keep that in mind, we'll come back to it, too.<br /><br /><blockquote>The ironic frame functions as a shield against criticism. The same goes 
for ironic living. Irony is the most self-defensive mode, as it allows a
 person to dodge responsibility for his or her choices, aesthetic and 
otherwise.<br /></blockquote><br />So this is true, but that's the <i>secondary</i> purpose of irony, not the <i>primary </i>purpose:&nbsp; in exchange for this self-defense, it puts all of the ironist's energy in the service of the thing it is defending against; that while he affects a distance from "all this", he participates 100% in it. However much the "not corporate" hip coffeehouse needs the barista's extensive roasting knowledge or values the ambiance he creates with his MFA and thoughts about <i>2666</i>, it is way more than the $7/hr no benefits it is paying him, but they got him, making skinny lattes for an organ donor in a light blue North Face coat while he and his Julliard buddy Garf roll their eyes disdainfully when she asks for two Splendas.&nbsp; "You're saying he's underpaid?"&nbsp; Yeah, but not the point, the point is why does he accept it?&nbsp; It's only because he can roll his eyes about how mainstream she is that he stays, it offers him a perch from which he is better than her, while simultaneously and no less ironically, this woman thinks she is better than him because she's on the correct side of the counter and her husband works on Wall Street.&nbsp; In math terms, the difference between what he is actually worth and the amount he is paid is how much he values feeling superior to MILFs.<br /><br />Or, if I can be permitted a judicious use of psychoanalytic jargon: it's the rationalization that allows you to blow a guy you can't stand, "I hate him but I'm going to make him cum so hard he'll just want more of me, which will be his punishment."&nbsp; Let that analogy sink in for a moment.&nbsp; From his perspective, not only did he still get blown, he liked it <i>even more</i>.&nbsp; NB: in this analogy, the guy is capitalism and you're not.<br /><br />III.<br /><br />Christy Wampole is an assistant professor of French at Princeton University, so 
right away you should be suspicious of&nbsp; her allegiances, so I figured this was just another NYT hit piece for its overeducated and overpaid demo.&nbsp; But then this happened:<br /><br /><blockquote>[The hipster] is merely a symptom and the most extreme manifestation of ironic 
living. <br /></blockquote><br />Hold on, something is amiss.&nbsp; There's a gigantic difference between an "archetype" and "merely a symptom", e.g. one is cause and the other is effect, and for a Professor of Confusing Words it's a big mistake to make-- especially when it's been reviewed by the editor at the NYT.&nbsp; It's about as big as missing the primary purpose of irony.&nbsp; Cause, or effect?&nbsp; They are almost opposites, which means she's <i>wants </i>them to be the same, which makes this <i>evidence of a defense</i>.&nbsp; So this article isn't simply "kids today are lazy."&nbsp; There's something else happening:<br /><br /><blockquote>For many Americans born in the 1980s and 1990s -- members of 
Generation Y, or Millennials -- particularly middle-class Caucasians, 
irony is the primary mode with which daily life is dealt.&nbsp; One need only dwell in public space, virtual or concrete, to see how 
pervasive this phenomenon has become. Advertising, politics, fashion, 
television: almost every category of contemporary reality exhibits this 
will to irony.<br /></blockquote><br />"Will to irony" may mean she's an idiot, and if this were 
true I could happily close my computer and buckle down 
to another night of alcoholic hallucinosis, but she's not an idiot, she's probably smarter than me, which means something far more 
sinister is going on: conflating the irony of the kids with the irony of the "public space."&nbsp; <i>Who does she think made the public space?</i>&nbsp; 20 somethings?&nbsp; Who is running the advertising agencies?&nbsp; Who is running for politics?&nbsp; How old is every legit fashion designer?&nbsp; Who is responsible for the human rights violations of the ABC Network?&nbsp; She's not decrying the hipster generation, she's describing <i>hers</i>.<br /><br /><br />IV.<br /><br />Here is a paragraph so preposterous I was sure this was a McSweeny's gag.&nbsp; But she didn't mean this to be ironic, which is itself ironic, good luck not laughing:<br /><br /><blockquote>Born in 1977, at the tail end of Generation X, I came of age in the 
1990s, a decade that, bracketed neatly by two architectural crumblings --
 of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the Twin Towers in 2001 -- now seems 
relatively irony-free. The grunge movement was serious in its aesthetics
 and its attitude, with a combative stance against authority, which the 
punk movement had also embraced. In my perhaps over-nostalgic memory, 
feminism reached an unprecedented peak, environmentalist concerns gained
 widespread attention, questions of race were more openly addressed......<br /></blockquote><br /><br /><br />"Relatively irony-free!&nbsp; Architectural crumblings! Socially conscious!&nbsp; Bosnia Herzigova or whatever!"&nbsp; I realize Aspirational 14% wants their beloved 90s to be about something more than just bicuriosity and JDSU, but I was there, it wasn't.&nbsp; Anyone who thinks the grunge movement was "serious" and "combative" and who thinks feminism "reached a peak" also thinks <a href="http://thelastpsychiatrist.com/2012/04/whats_wrong_with_the_hunger_ga_1.html">The Hunger Games</a> was a step forward for women and <i>50 Shades</i> is poorly written "but still hot."&nbsp; Just because you call yourself a progressive or a feminist, doesn't make it true, your progressive passions may end up setting women back five hundred years-- that's right, <i>500 years</i>.&nbsp; Even 200 years ago Catherine took power away from her husband and became something great, Walpole's is the generation that admires Hillary Clinton as a female role model, not because she became Secretary of State, but because she stayed with her husband so that she could become Secretary of State.&nbsp; Read it again if you didn't get it the first time, it's important.&nbsp; I forbid you from having daughters.&nbsp; Or oxygen.&nbsp; I know, I know, I don't have any real power, <i>but maybe someday a man will give me some</i>.<br /><br /><br /><br />V.<br /><br /><br />When someone hates something that to outside observers looks exactly 
like themselves in every way, you should quickly consult a French book 
to see if they don't have a word for that phenomenon, and they do, it's 
called projection.<br /><br />Before you nod and use it to hate on her, you 
should understand what projection is.&nbsp; It sounds like you project unwanted feelings onto another person, which is both wrong and impossible.&nbsp; It's not an action, it's a problem of perception.&nbsp; The unwanted feelings don't make sense coming from someone <i>like you</i>, so you conclude they must be coming from the other person.<br /><br />To use the frequent example of "homophobia": a guy feels gay impulses and can't "handle it" but he doesn't get rid of them by putting them onto someone else, he <i>confuses</i> them as coming from someone else.&nbsp; He smells gayness, "Where is it coming from?&nbsp; Me?&nbsp; Impossible! Jesus washed my feet.&nbsp; Must be that guy." &nbsp; Sorry, wildman, whoever smelt it dealt it.&nbsp; Projection is the <i>most</i> primitive of defenses, circa age 2, and the description should make it clear it is a narcissistic defense: one's perception of the world is inextricably, concretely the result of one's inner states.&nbsp; There is no "objectivity" possible.&nbsp; <br /><br />The purpose of projection is not to get rid of the feelings, but to explain their presence, to defend the self against a label: "I'm not gay..... even if I have gay sex once in a while."&nbsp; The point isn't to avoid gay sex, the gayness isn't intolerable to them-- e.g. observe the high hat Christians caught in various rest stops across our land-- but even thought they've committed the act, it doesn't affect their identity.<br /><br />My use of gay as an example is unfortunate because half of you will see "gay" as "bad," but the projected impulse doesn't have to be "bad", merely incongruous to the desired identity that you are trying to solidify. &nbsp; If you doubt this, consider the sullen engineering student at a party, "I'm not like these superficial sorority girls with perfect smiles and condomless sex" who then <i>perceives</i> great happiness in these people.<br /><br /><br /><img alt="find and replace.jpg" src="http://thelastpsychiatrist.com/images/find%20and%20replace.jpg" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" height="210" width="441" />&nbsp; <br />You could be happy, too, dude, if you weren't so invested in not being happy.&nbsp; If you want a partial understanding of why 19-21 Saudi/Egyptian terrorists could live in America and enjoy our strip clubs but still want to crumble our architecture, there you go.&nbsp; <br /><br />The article continues with a "nuanced" criticism of irony and the hipster mindset, and then towards the end she tries a reversal, but it's a trick, not because it's not genuine, it is, but precisely because it is genuine: <br /><br /><br /><blockquote>Obviously, hipsters (male or female) produce a distinct irritation in 
me, one that until recently I could not explain. They provoke me, I 
realized, because they are, despite the distance from which I observe 
them, an amplified version of me.<br /></blockquote><br />So true; totally wrong.&nbsp; When people "figure themselves out" and then applaud themselves for their "brutal self-honesty", you can be sure it is further defense.&nbsp; The easiest way for a self-aware person to protect himself is to "figure out" something that is actually correct so that he stops there and doesn't go any further, which is also the problem with most therapies.&nbsp; "I'm learning a lot about myself and my motivations."&nbsp; No you're not.&nbsp; "Figuring yourself out" not only fails, but is the defense itself.&nbsp; Stop doing it. <br /><br />She thinks she "realizes" hipsters are an amplified version of her, i.e.
 that she is projecting-- which is in fact/duh correct, but never asks the question, "Why am I projecting?&nbsp; What do I benefit from this madness?&nbsp; How does the system benefit?"<br /><br />There are so many ways, let's just take one.&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the result of her work product ironic?&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Then it's in the service of the system, while she is able to affect a distance from "all this" she participates 100% in it. <br /><br />However much the NYT values her PhD, however much they value her intellect and opinions, it's way more than what they paid her, which is nothing.&nbsp; The question is, <i>why didn't she demand to be paid</i>?&nbsp; I'm not saying you have to do everything for money, god knows I write a lot of blog and drink very long rums and neither one have delivered profits commensurate with the labor.&nbsp; If she was promoting something of course I'd understand writing for free, but what can she do after writing for the Times except write for the Times <i>again</i>?&nbsp; See also Princeton, where you will pay them more to get the degree that they will then pay you less to use for them, in no other profession is learning how to do something more valuable than actually doing it. Is that ironic?&nbsp; Then she is able to affect a distance from "all this" while she participates 100% in it.&nbsp; Undoubtedly she's thinking, "well, hell, I got an article in the Times!" as if that has some incalculable value, but that's the trick.&nbsp; It doesn't.&nbsp; It's a scam.<br /><br />"I'm not a vicious capitalist, I don't always have to get paid for what I do. I like to participate in the public debate."&nbsp; I. I. I.&nbsp; Stop it, look around! &nbsp; This isn't charity, the Times is a billion dollar corporation and Princeton is in actuality a gigantic hedge fund-- <i>why are you giving </i>them<i> your work for free</i>?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's the system, I can't change it."&nbsp; Exactly.<br /><br />No different than the person who doesn't ask for a raise because they're
 nervous, "should I ask for 5% more?" and they agonize about it for a month, ten months.&nbsp; The point isn't whether you deserve the extra money, the point is whether you deserve it <i>more than the company</i>, because if you don't take the extra money home to your kids, the company takes it to theirs.&nbsp; Note that no one ever frames it this way, it is always about "making a case" or "explaining how you can both benefit." &nbsp; Note also that in most cases the person you'd ask for a raise is a manager, one who has no investment in 
that money, it doesn't come out of his pocket.&nbsp; Yet he is
 the biggest obstacle, he will put sugar in your gas tank to stop you from getting that raise.&nbsp; Is that ironic?&nbsp; Or totally the point?&nbsp; <br /><br /><i>Glengarry Glen Ross</i> is on Netflix, you should watch it a lot.&nbsp; The easy "critique of capitalism" is that "second prize is a set of steak knives" because that's how little it costs to motivate you to work harder for them, and if that doesn't work there's always "third prize is you're fired."&nbsp; But the real wisdom which is not about capitalism but which is about narcissism comes from understanding that first prize isn't a Cadillac Eldorado, you think Alec Baldwin needs a <i>car</i>?&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>There is no first prize.</i>&nbsp; Real closers don't <i>want</i> the prize, they want to be the best, that's why they will practice practice practice and don't play the lottery.&nbsp; The car is a temptation only for people who do not know their own value, the value of their own work, who won't lift a finger to advance themselves, who are motivated only by threats or by rewards, who would rather have the appearance of success than actual success. "I got an article in the Times!"&nbsp; celebrates the person whose brain is broken.&nbsp; "Alec Baldwin's character is a raging narcissist!" Jesus are you stupid, Alec's name is MacGuffin, that's why he's in Act I and never again yet propels the story forward.&nbsp; It is irrelevant whether Alec Baldwin has metal testicles or pathological grandiosity, what matters is that after years of C minus work, what finally gets those dummies fired up is First Prize or Third Prize, left to themselves they meander in mediocrity while deluding themselves that they are more than what they do. "I was number one in '87!"&nbsp; So was <i>Alf</i>. &nbsp; And the system knows this, which is why it lets Wampole call herself a professor but pays her like a TA-----&nbsp; <i>and she's upset at hipsters</i>.&nbsp; Is that ironic? &nbsp; <br /><br />She's criticizing-- sorry, critiquing-- hipsters for their defensive posture against society, and for not working, but, look, at least they are not working for free, like a Matrix battery propping up the very system that sucks the life out of them.&nbsp; "Well, it's cool that I got an article in the Times, maybe I'll get to write another one."&nbsp; I know, I know, the temptation of a moment of <i>celebrity</i> was too great to resist, only a fool would pass it up.&nbsp;&nbsp; Meanwhile Princeton is happy to use her to market their anti-hipster brand to the demo that has the money to send their batteries to Princeton one day. &nbsp; However much Princeton values her article to the NYT, it is way more than they... never mind. <br /><br />The thing is, if I tie her to a chair and shine the heat lamp on her and ask her whose fault "all this" is, she'll answer the Republicans.&nbsp; Since she's a nuanced thinker she'll probably say George Bush.&nbsp; And when she has to get a job at Rutgers because Princeton won't give her tenure, she'll blame the tax cuts or "an undercurrent of sexism in academia."&nbsp; But she will save and save and save to send her own daughters to college one day, hey, if you send them to Rutgers they'll generously give a 10% employee discount.&nbsp; Sweet! <br /><br />You gave the system you don't like a spectacular blowjob, and then try to punish it by making it want you more.&nbsp; From the system's perspective, not only did it still get blown, it liked it <i>even more</i>.&nbsp; In this analogy, the system is the system and you're not.<br /><br /><br /><br /><a href="http://twitter.com/thelastpsych">http://twitter.com/thelastpsych</a><br /><br />]]>

<div align="center"><font style="font-size: 0.8em;">do you have a better system?</font><br /></div>]]>
        <![CDATA[<br /><br /><br />The funeral is attended by 30 people. It's a military funeral because he was in Korea, and in the front chairs are his wife and two grown children, and they are quietly crying. <br /><br />When it ends, people disperse hesitatingly, after all, they themselves aren't sad, they didn't know him, they knew his kids.&nbsp; So they are unsure of what they're supposed to do next, but the answer is you keep going, there's nothing else to do but that.&nbsp; That's the point of a funeral.<br /><br />The deceased's wife has mourned her part, for now, and accompanied by her adult son walks away.&nbsp; The adult daughter approaches the coffin, sobbing.&nbsp; She is pretty, which unfortunately is relevant.&nbsp; Her husband hugs her, and then takes their two little girls away from her, down towards the road, giving the woman the required freedom to be someone's daughter one last time.&nbsp; <br /><br />She kneels at the coffin.&nbsp; She cries.&nbsp; Everyone can hear it.&nbsp; It is sad.<br /><br /><br />II.<br /><br />But some people are unsatisfied with a system that's been in place 
for more millennia than years they've been alive. They don't trust that it's effective because when the 
funeral is over <i>people are still sad</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp; What kind of stupid ritual is that?&nbsp; These people want to change the system, they believe they know a better way. <br /><br />Most people instinctively turn away and give her some kind of privacy, but about ten of them move forward to surround her: <i>what's this? A woman crying?&nbsp; At a funeral??</i> They huddle around her in a semi-circle, hyenas waiting for a signal.&nbsp; One hyena steps forward, tries to hug her from behind; and you can see the surprise in that dummy's face when he doesn't get the expected hug back, <i>when it doesn't seem to help</i>, the grieving daughter doesn't stop crying, she doesn't even get up.&nbsp; The hyena is caught awkwardly, so he rests his paws on the woman's shoulders, and now the sobbing woman must associate her last chance to be with what is left of her father with the stale breath of a sycophant waiting for his moment to be relevant.<br /><br />And while that's going on others are whispering to the quivering back of her coat, "oh, I'm so sorry",&nbsp; "I'm sure he really loved you",&nbsp; "are you ok?"<br /><br />Why did any one of them think they had the power, the right, to interfere with another person's mourning?&nbsp; This was between her and her father and God and no one else.&nbsp; Did no one notice that even the husband had given her space?&nbsp; Did they just think he was being a jerk?&nbsp; "I just wanted to comfort her."&nbsp; No, you didn't know what else to do, so you did that.&nbsp; "I didn't want her to be alone."&nbsp;&nbsp; That's because you are a terrible person.<br /><br />They do not know how to stand in the presence of grief because they can't help but make it immediately a judgment of themselves-- <i>how can you see a woman crying and not do anything</i>?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Purposeless hyperactivity to cover up one's impotence and lack of empathy.&nbsp; "But I'm not the one grieving, I can't fake being sad."&nbsp; Don't fake it, just be silently and unobtrusively available. I know you don't think you're the most important person there, but you are also not the second most important.&nbsp; Or the third or tenth.&nbsp; Get out of the way.&nbsp; <br /><br />But they can't, they think it has suddenly become their responsibility to save you. Look around, all those other people-- yours?&nbsp; Do you think you can?&nbsp; Do you think that anything you say is going to bring the dead back?&nbsp; Ease her suffering?<br /><br />She's supposed to be sad, she needs to be sad, if she wasn't crying enough I'd kick her in the shins to make her, otherwise she will hold all of that emotion and let it out piecemeal over three decades and she will be lost.<br /><br />These animals suffer from a deep existential pathology for which there 
is no cure, in ordinary times they will be the most ordinary people but 
when the ship goes down they will kill each other to make sure they get a
 lifeboat all for themselves.&nbsp; Medicine won't help this, religion won't 
help this.&nbsp; On the one hand they don't know how to be real, on the other
 hand they they think protocol and formality is dishonest and insensitive.&nbsp; They can't say, "my condolences" because it sounds fake.&nbsp; So they improvise, catastrophically.<br /><br />We should all be so lucky that as adults we get to attend our father's funeral, doesn't make it easier but that's a fact, because the alternative is that it happens the other way around, and I can think of nothing worse than the other way around.&nbsp; But <i>even then</i> the system is in place, if you blindly follow the steps-- if people let you blindly follow the steps-- then when you are finished you can begin to go back to your life.&nbsp; Death creates a hole in your heart that is unfillable, but if you follow the steps you can at least fence it off so you don't keep falling in.&nbsp; <br /><br />There is no shortcut to mourning, the shortcut leads to madness.&nbsp; When you subvert the system and offer a mourner a shortcut, you are leading them to madness.<br /><br />But how can she let go, how can she do what needs to be done, under the oppressive gaze of <i>self-conscious </i>people who need her to know they came?&nbsp; "I just want to support her!"&nbsp; Then you'd go back to your car, connect a hose from the exhaust pipe to a slightly opened window, and wait it out.&nbsp; <br /><br />When she first told people about her father's death it came with a <i>gift</i> to others, a qualifier: "I won't be there on Wednesday, my father passed away and I'll be at the funeral-- <i>it's ok, I'm fine</i>" but nevertheless grown neophytes went to Defcon 5.&nbsp; This is one such text message: "OH MY GOD, ARE YOU SERIOUS!&nbsp; OH MY GOD, I AM SO SORRY, WHAT HAPPENED??&nbsp; PLEASE CALL ME IMMEDIATELY!!"&nbsp; The text message ends there because I smashed it.<br /><br />One man, either a friend or a blastoma, came to the funeral luncheon mostly to ask the daughter what was up with her girlfriend he was trying to date.&nbsp; He's 50.&nbsp; I know he didn't think he was being selfish or insensitive, he truly believed she'd welcome the chance to talk about his relationship, she'd want him to be happy, she'd use this sad day to tell him how love was the most important thing in the world and he should seize it because life is so short.&nbsp; That's how it happened in <i>Four Weddings And A Funeral</i>, anyway.&nbsp; I will bet you all of your money that as he got dressed in his black suit and lavender shirt, inside his head was playing, "going to the chapel and we're....."&nbsp; Did he come to support her?&nbsp; No, he came to destroy the world.&nbsp; <br /><br />Six different psychopaths called her to demand they come to the the funeral to "show their support."&nbsp; <i>Who do you think you are fooling?</i>&nbsp; Each of them wanted to be the <i>best</i> friend that would accompany her through the terrible day.&nbsp; Each of them believed that they were the best friend that would do this.&nbsp; But just because she's on the phone with you all the time solving your crises, it doesn't make you a best friend, it makes you a patient.&nbsp; A real best friend wouldn't use a funeral as a way of solidify their own place as "best friend." A real best friend wouldn't feel jealous that some other friend got to sit closer, got more attention.<br /><br />One psychophant who came to the luncheon to "show support" didn't get the extra acknowledgement she expected, so she decided instead to perform unsolicited grief therapy on the woman's five year old daughter.&nbsp; "Since we didn't get a chance to connect at the funeral," she said later, "[your daughter] and I had a good talk about what happens when you die." If I had seen this happen I'd be in prison now.&nbsp; The only thing this woman can connect with is a phone charger, the battery is always dying.&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hi, I just texted you, I wanted to see if you were free to talk about me, but I only have two hours."<br /><br />It's not your day, your method sadness is irrelevant, your pseudo-concern transparent and you are <i>forcing </i>mourners to divert their attention to you. &nbsp; "I had Christ in my mouth for over an hour!" was a post funeral text from a woman who... what?&nbsp; I'm not a Catholic so it took me a few minutes to piece together that this lunatic meant she had kept the Eucharist from the funeral mass in her mouth without swallowing it for an hour-- <i>as if that meant something</i>. &nbsp; Woman, you are insane, your personal relationship with Jesus is pathological, I'll guess you voted for Romney but you are the reason Obama won.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's bad enough you think your God wants you to be an hysterical neurotic, but why would you then tell this to a woman mourning her father?&nbsp; Why would you think she'd derive comfort from what <i>you </i>did?<br /><br />It's no surprise that the new DSM removes the bereavement exception from the
 diagnosis of depression-- no one allows normal bereavement to occur.&nbsp; How can ordinary bereavement ever occur when 
it is subverted, worsened, at every turn by people who were never taught how to act
 around other people, who just don't know? &nbsp; "I just want to help."&nbsp; You are destroying the 
world.<br /><br />I understand funerals can be awkward for those not directly grieving, 
but over-exaggerating your pretend sadness is of no benefit to anyone, 
it merely obligates the survivors to manage your fake concern.&nbsp; If you 
feel compelled to speak in all caps or explain how terrible this all is 
to a person who knows first hand and way better than you how terrible it all is, don't.&nbsp; 
Stay home.&nbsp; When you find yourself in the presence of mourning, simply say,&nbsp; "I'm 
sorry for your loss.&nbsp; If there's anything I can do for you, please let 
me know," and if he happened also to have been a great man you can add, "he was a great man," then bow your head and fade to back.&nbsp;&nbsp; That's 
all that's necessary.&nbsp; The system will take care of the rest.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />]]>
