<p>John Urschel is a PhD student in the Applied Mathematics program at MIT. He has co-authored <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.06325">two</a> <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024379514000743">papers</a> with his Penn State Master&#8217;s advisor, Ludmil Zikatanov, on spectra-based approximation algorithms for the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{&#92;mathsf{NP}}" title="{&#92;mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" />-complete graph bisection problem. A followup <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.0565">paper</a> with Zikatanov and two others exploited the earlier work to give new fast solvers for minimal eigenvectors of graph Laplacians. He also plays offensive guard for the NFL Baltimore Ravens.</p>
<p>
Today Ken and I wish to talk about a new result by the front linesman of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{&#92;mathsf{NP}}" title="{&#92;mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" />-completeness, Dick Karp, about football.</p>
<p>
Karp&#8212;Dick&#8212;-is a huge fan of various sports. Recently at Avi Wigderson&#8217;s birthday conference, held at Princeton&#8217;s IAS, he told me a neat new result on how to play football. It concerns a basic decision that a coach faces after his team scores a touchdown: kick for one extra point or attempt a riskier &#8220;two-point conversion&#8221; play. </p>
<p>
We wonder whether players like Urschel might be useful for blocking out these decisions, more than blocking and opening &#8220;holes&#8221; for runners. By the way Urschel, who attended Canisius High School in Buffalo before his B.S. and M.S. plus a Stats minor at Penn State, is no stranger to IAS. Here he is with my friend Peter Sarnak there last year:</p>
<table style="margin:auto;">

<p>
Thus he is doing all the things we would advise a young theorist or mathematician to do: publish, circulate, talk about interesting problems, get on a research team, and open up avenues for deep penetration and advances by teammates. </p>
<p>
<p><H2> The Football Rules </H2></p>
<p><p>
After a touchdown is made the team scoring gets 6 points. It then has an option:</p>
<ol>
<li>
The team can kick the ball and try to get it through the goal posts. This is worth 1 extra point. </p>
<li>
The team can try to get the ball into the end zone by running or throwing it. This is worth 2 extra points.
</ol>
<p><p>
Traditionally the right call in most game situations is (1). Usually the kicker can make the ball go through the posts most of the time, while getting the ball into the end zone is much more difficult. Of course at the end of a game there may be reasons to try for the 2 points. If the game is about over and you need 2 points to tie, that is probably the best play.</p>
<p><a href="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/football.png"><img src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/football.png?w=130&#038;h=97" alt="football" width="130" height="97" class="aligncenter wp-image-13777" /></a></p>
<p><H2> Karp&#8217;s Insight </H2></p>
<p><p>
Karp set up a basic model of this decision. His model is a bit idealized, but I expect that he can and will make it more realistic in the future. The version I heard over a wonderful dinner that Kathryn Farley, my wife, set up for a small group of friends was not the proper venue to go into various technical details. So I will just relay his basic idea. </p>
<p>
In his model we make several assumptions: </p>
<ol>
<li>
We assume that the kicker is perfect: every try for the kick option works. Especially now with the kick moved back from the 2 to the 15 yard line, that is a pipe dream for any coach in the NFL, but it makes the discussion cleaner. </p>
<li>
We assume that the 2-point option succeeds 1/2 the time. That actually was exactly the case over a recent five-year stretch in the NFL. </p>
<li>
We assume that the team will score many touchdowns and therefore will face many such decisions.
</ol>
<p>
The last clause means that we&#8217;re modeling the choice by an infinite walk. If you wish you may subtract 1 so that a kick gives 0, a successful play gives +1, but an unsuccessful one gives -1. Karp&#8217;s question is this:</p>
<blockquote><p>
What should the coach do? Always kick or sometimes go for two?
</p></blockquote>
<p>
You might think about it before reading on for Karp&#8217;s answer.</p>
<p><P><br />
<P></p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cdots+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="&#92;displaystyle  &#92;dots " title="&#92;displaystyle  &#92;dots " class="latex" /></p>
<p><P><br />
His insight is this:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Theorem 1 (Fundamental Theorem of Football?)</b> <em> The optimal strategy is initially always to go for two. If after some number <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2t-1%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{2t-1}" title="{2t-1}" class="latex" /> of tries you have succeeded <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{t}" title="{t}" class="latex" /> times, so that you are ahead of what kicking would have brought, switch over to kicking. </em></p></blockquote>
<p>
<p><H2> Not Gambler&#8217;s Ruin? </H2></p>
<p><p>
Ken&#8217;s first reaction was to note a difference from &#8220;gambler&#8217;s ruin&#8221; which means to double-down after every lost 50-50 bet. In football this would mean that after you missed one conversion play, the next try would bring +3 points on success but subtract 1 from your score if you missed. Next time you could go for 5 but failure would cost 3. If you think in the +1/-1 terms compared to 0 for kicking, then this is the classic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martingale_(betting_system)">martingale</a> system of doubling the bet 1,2,4,8&#8230; until you win and net +1. The ruin for gamblers is the chance of swiftly going bankrupt&#8212;but in football you can only lose one game.</p>
<p>
However, we are not allowing doubling the bet either. It&#8217;s the classic random walk situation: right or left along the number line with equal probability, except that you can elect to stop and stay where you are. With probability 1, such a walk starting at 0 will reach a stage in positive territory at +1 net, and then we stop. </p>
<p>
A real game, of course, does not have unboundedly many touchdowns&#8212;though some college games I&#8217;ve watched have sure felt like it. So if you miss a few two-point tries and the game is deep into the second half, you&#8217;re left holding the bag of foregone points. </p>
<p>
<p><H2> Toward Deepening the Result </H2></p>
<p><p>
The question comes down to, what is the utility of nosing ahead by the extra point when you succeed, compared to being down more when you fail? How likely are game scenarios where that one extra point is the decider? To be concrete, suppose you score 3 touchdowns in the first three quarters. Following Karp&#8217;s strategy nets you an extra point 5/8 of the time: succeed the first time then kick twice, or fail the first time and succeed twice. Just 1/4 of the time you&#8217;ve lost a point, but 1/8 of the time you&#8217;re net -3 and need an extra field goal to get back to par.</p>
<p>
There are late-game situations where the extra point is worth so much that it pays to go for two even with a chance <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bs%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{s}" title="{s}" class="latex" /> of success that is under 40%. Suppose you are down 14 points and score a touchdown with 4 minutes left. You have enough time to stop the other team and get the ball back again for one more drive, but that&#8217;s basically it. You have to assume you will score a touchdown on that drive too, so the only variable is the conversion decision. The issue is that if you kick now and kick again, you&#8217;ve only tied the game and have a 50% win chance in overtime. Whereas if you go for two you have an <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bs%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{s}" title="{s}" class="latex" /> chance of winning based on this figuring, plus if you fail you can still tie and get to overtime after your next TD. Thus your win expectation is </p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++s+%2B+0.5%281-s%29s+%3D+1.5s+-+0.5s%5E2%2C+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="&#92;displaystyle  s + 0.5(1-s)s = 1.5s - 0.5s^2, " title="&#92;displaystyle  s + 0.5(1-s)s = 1.5s - 0.5s^2, " class="latex" /></p>
<p>
which crosses 50% when </p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++s+%3D+%283+-+%5Csqrt%7B5%7D%29%2F2+%3D+2+-+%5Cphi+%3D+0.381966%5Cdots+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="&#92;displaystyle  s = (3 - &#92;sqrt{5})/2 = 2 - &#92;phi = 0.381966&#92;dots " title="&#92;displaystyle  s = (3 - &#92;sqrt{5})/2 = 2 - &#92;phi = 0.381966&#92;dots " class="latex" /></p>
<p>
When <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bs+%3D+0.5%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{s = 0.5}" title="{s = 0.5}" class="latex" /> you have a <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B5%2F8%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{5/8}" title="{5/8}" class="latex" /> expectation by going for two. Yet for human reasons, this is not on the standard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-point_conversion#Two-point_conversion_chart">chart</a> of game situations calling for a two-point try. The human bias is toward maximizing your chances of &#8220;staying in the game&#8221; which is not the same as maximizing winning. There was a neat <a href="https://www.chess.com/blog/smurfo/nakamura-and-mcshanes-big-mistake">analysis</a> of a similar situation in chess last year.</p>
<p>
The challenging question to deepen Karp&#8217;s insight is, how far can we sensibly broaden this kind of analysis? Does this observation apply in real games? It seems to call for a big modeling and simulation effort, guided by theory where we might vary Karp&#8217;s simple rule and adjust for different probabilities of success on both the two-point tries and the kicks. This would bring it into the realm of machine learning with high-dimensional data, and per remarks on Urschel&#8217;s MIT <a href="http://math.mit.edu/~urschel/">homepage</a>, perhaps he is headed that way.</p>
<p>
<p><H2> Open Problems </H2></p>
<p><p>
What do you think of the insight for football strategy? We could also talk about when (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/30/upshot/nfl-announcers-are-bad-at-math-too.html?_r=0">not</a>) to punt&#8230;</p>
<p>
Urschel missed this season&#8217;s first three games but is starting at left guard right now for the Ravens, who are beating up on my Giants 10-0 as we go to post. Oh well. Of course he reminds me I once <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2010/03/18/the-quarterback-and-the-professor/">took classes</a> from an NFL quarterback who similarly &#8220;went for two&#8221; in football and mathematics. We wish Urschel all the best and will follow his careers with interest. Enjoy the games today and tomorrow night.</p>

<p>
Jamie Morgenstern is a researcher into machine learning, economics, and especially mechanism design. </p>
<p>
Today Ken and I would like to discuss a joint paper of hers on the classic problem of matching schools and students.</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1407.2640">paper</a> is titled, &#8220;Approximately Stable, School Optimal, and Student-Truthful Many-to-One Matchings (via Differential Privacy).&#8221; It is joint with Sampath Kannan, Aaron Roth, and Zhiwei Wu. Let&#8217;s call this paper (KMRW). She gave a <a href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/calendar/day/2015/02/02/5539">talk</a> on it at Georgia Tech last year.</p>
<p>
<p><H2> The Classic Matching Problems </H2></p>
<p><p>
There are various instances of matching-type problems, but perhaps the most important is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Resident_Matching_Program#Matching_algorithm">NRMP</a> assignment of graduating medical students to their first hospital appointments. In 2012 Lloyd Shapley and Alvin Roth&#8212;Aaron&#8217;s father&#8212;were <a href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/2012/popular-economicsciences2012.pdf">awarded</a> the Nobel Prize in Economics &#8220;for the theory of stable allocations and the practice of market design.&#8221;</p>
<p>
The original matching problem was that of marrying females and males, on which we just <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2016/10/05/congratulations-noam/">posted</a> about a recent joint paper of Noam Nisan. Here is a standard description of the stable matching problem (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_marriage_problem">SMP</a>):</p>
<blockquote><p>
Assume there are <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{n}" title="{n}" class="latex" /> men and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{n}" title="{n}" class="latex" /> women. Further each has a linear ranking of the members of the opposite sex. Find a way to marry all the men and all the women so that the assignment is <b>stable</b>. This means that no two people would both rather marry each other instead of the partners they are assigned to.
</p></blockquote>
<p><p>
In 1962, David Gale and Shapley proved that any SMP always has a solution, and even better, they gave a quadratic time algorithm that finds it. SMP as stated is less practical than the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_roommates_problem">problem</a> that results if the men are also allowed to marry each other, likewise the women, with everyone ranking everyone else as partners. But in the same famous <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/2312726?origin=crossref&amp;seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents">paper</a>, Gale and Shapley solved an even more realistic problem:</p>
<blockquote><p>
The hospitals/residents problem&#8212;also known as the college admissions problem&#8212;differs from the stable marriage problem in that the &#8220;women&#8221; can accept &#8220;proposals&#8221; from more than one &#8220;man&#8221; (e.g., a hospital can take multiple residents, or a college can take an incoming class of more than one student). Algorithms to solve the hospitals/residents problem can be hospital-oriented (female-optimal) or resident-oriented (male-optimal). This problem was solved, with an algorithm, in the original paper by Gale and Shapley, in which SMP was solved.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Let&#8217;s call this the college admissions problem (CAP).</p>
<p>
<p><H2> Gaming the System </H2></p>

Consider adding another condition to CAP. Stability is clearly an important requirement&#8212;without it there would be students and colleges that would prefer to swap their choices. Having stability which avoids such a situation is quite nice. It does not force the assignment to be perfect in any sense, but does make it at least a &#8220;local&#8221; optimal solution. This is important, and it is used in real assignment problems today.</p>
<p>
Yet there is a possibility that students, for example, could &#8220;game&#8221; the system. What if a student selected a strange ordering of schools that they claim they wish to attend. But the list is not really what they want. Why would they do this? Simply they may be able to <i>lie</i> about their preferences to insure that they get their top choice. </p>
<p>
The basic point seems easiest to illustrate in the non-gender, single-party case, so let&#8217;s say <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%2CB%2CC%2CD%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{A,B,C,D}" title="{A,B,C,D}" class="latex" /> need to form two pairs. They have circular first choices and second choices in the opposite circle: </p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++A+%5Crightarrow+B+%5Crightarrow+C+%5Crightarrow+D+%5Crightarrow+A%3B+%5Cqquad+A+%5CLongrightarrow+D+%5CLongrightarrow+C+%5CLongrightarrow+B+%5CLongrightarrow+A.+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="&#92;displaystyle  A &#92;rightarrow B &#92;rightarrow C &#92;rightarrow D &#92;rightarrow A; &#92;qquad A &#92;Longrightarrow D &#92;Longrightarrow C &#92;Longrightarrow B &#92;Longrightarrow A.

They could have had their first choices under the also-stable configuration <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28AD%2CBC%29%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{(AD,BC)}" title="{(AD,BC)}" class="latex" /> but there was no way to force the algorithm to choose it. However, let&#8217;s suppose <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{B}" title="{B}" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BD%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{D}" title="{D}" class="latex" /> lie and declare <em>each other</em> to be their second choices: </p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++A+%5Crightarrow+B+%5Crightarrow+C+%5Crightarrow+D+%5Crightarrow+A%3B+%5Cqquad+A+%5CLongrightarrow+D+%5CLongrightarrow+B%3B%5Cquad+C+%5CLongrightarrow+B+%5CLongrightarrow+D.+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="&#92;displaystyle  A &#92;rightarrow B &#92;rightarrow C &#92;rightarrow D &#92;rightarrow A; &#92;qquad A &#92;Longrightarrow D &#92;Longrightarrow B;&#92;quad C &#92;Longrightarrow B &#92;Longrightarrow D.

<p>
The algorithm given these preferences sees <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28AB%2CCD%29%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{(AB,CD)}" title="{(AB,CD)}" class="latex" /> as unstable since <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{B}" title="{B}" class="latex" /> would join with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BD%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{D}" title="{D}" class="latex" />, and the resulting <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28AC%2CBD%29%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{(AC,BD)}" title="{(AC,BD)}" class="latex" /> as unstable because <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{A}" title="{A}" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BD%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{D}" title="{D}" class="latex" /> would prefer each other.

Given what they may have known about <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{A}" title="{A}" class="latex" />&#8216;s and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{C}" title="{C}" class="latex" />&#8216;s preference lists, there was no danger they&#8217;d actually have to pair up. Examples in the two-gender and student-college cases need six actors but the ideas are similar.</p>
<p>
<p><H2> Systematizing the Game </H2></p>
<p><p>
The basic Gale-Shapley algorithm for the two-party case actually has two &#8220;poles&#8221; depending on which party has its preferences attended to first. The current NRMP algorithm favors the applicants first. In college admissions one can imagine the schools going first. Alvin Roth <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/cf51/08ca274bdf762193ffdc8d2b2c95208af1b0.pdf">proved</a> that the poles had the following impact on truthfulness:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<b>Theorem 5.</b> In the matching procedure which always yields the optimal stable outcome for a given one of the two sets of agents (i.e., for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{M}" title="{M}" class="latex" /> or for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BW%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{W}" title="{W}" class="latex" />), truthful revelation is a dominant strategy for all the agents in that set.</p>
<p>
<b>Corollary 5.1.</b> In the matching procedure which always yields the optimal stable outcome for a given set of agents, the agents in the other set have no incentive to misrepresent their first choice.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
A <em>dominant strategy</em> here means a submitted list of preferences that the individual has no motive to change under any combination of preferences submitted by the other agents (on either side). The upshot is that the favored side has no reason to deviate from their true preferences, but the non-favored side has motive to spy on each other (short of colluding) and lie about their second and further preferences. </p>
<p>
There has been much research on improving fairness by mediating between the &#8220;poles&#8221; but this has not solved the truthfulness issue. Can we structure the algorithm so that it still finds stable configurations but works in a way that both parties have incentive to be <i>truthful</i> and use their real orderings? </p>
<p>
Unfortunately, Roth&#8217;s same paper proved that there is no method to solve SMP or CAP that is both stable and truthful. Only the above conditions on one side or the other are possible.</p>
<p>
<p><H2> Can We Handle Truth? </H2></p>
<p><p>
Roth&#8217;s negative result reminds me of the famous <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104257/quotes">dialogue</a> toward the end of the 1992 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Few_Good_Men">movie</a> <em>A Few Good Men</em>:</p>
<p><P><br />
<b>Judge Randolph</b>: Consider yourself in contempt!</p>
<p>

<p>
<b>Judge Randolph</b>: You <em>don&#8217;t</em> have to answer that question!</p>
<p>
<b>Col. Jessup</b>: I&#8217;ll answer the question!</p>
<p>

<p>

<p>
<b>Kaffee</b>: <em>I want the truth!</em></p>
<p>
<b>Col. Jessup</b>: <em>You can&#8217;t handle the truth!</em></p>
<p><P><br />
However, a recurring theme in theory especially since the 1980s is that often we can work around such negative results by:</p>
<ul>
<li>
randomizing so that requirements hold &#8220;with high probability&#8221; or &#8220;in expected case,&#8221; and/or</p>
<li>
accepting approximations, and/or</p>
<li>
making results (more) asymptotic, and/or</p>
<li>
fencing off undesirable cases in some way.
</ul>
<p>
Recall that in the college admissions case where the schools act first, the schools have no motive to do other than declare their true preferences, but the students might profit if they submit bogus second, third, and further preferences to the algorithm. The new KMRW paper states the following: </p>
<blockquote><p>
We present a mechanism for computing asymptotically stable school optimal matchings, while guaranteeing that it is an asymptotic dominant strategy for every student to report their true preferences to the mechanism. Our main tool in this endeavor is differential privacy: we give an algorithm that coordinates a stable matching using differentially private signals, which lead to our truthfulness guarantee. This is the first setting in which it is known how to achieve nontrivial truthfulness guarantees for students when computing school optimal matchings, assuming worst- case preferences (for schools and students) in large markets.
</p></blockquote>

There is also an approximation condition on the potential gain from lying about preferences.

Given <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ceta+%3E+0%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{&#92;eta &gt; 0}" title="{&#92;eta &gt; 0}" class="latex" />, say the preference list <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL_i%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{L_i}" title="{L_i}" class="latex" /> submitted by <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba_i%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{a_i}" title="{a_i}" class="latex" /> is <em><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ceta%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{&#92;eta}" title="{&#92;eta}" class="latex" />-approximately dominant</em> if for all other lists <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL%27_i%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{L&#039;_i}" title="{L&#039;_i}" class="latex" /> by <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba_i%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{a_i}" title="{a_i}" class="latex" />&#8212;and all lists submitted by other students which induce the mappings <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmu%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{&#92;mu}" title="{&#92;mu}" class="latex" /> with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL_i%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{L_i}" title="{L_i}" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmu%27%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{&#92;mu&#039;}" title="{&#92;mu&#039;}" class="latex" /> with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL%27_i%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{L&#039;_i}" title="{L&#039;_i}" class="latex" />&#8212;we have </p>

<p>
In fact, KMRW pull the randomization lever by stipulating the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ceta%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{&#92;eta}" title="{&#92;eta}" class="latex" /> bound only on the difference in expected values over matchings <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmu%2C%5Cmu%27%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{&#92;mu,&#92;mu&#039;}" title="{&#92;mu,&#92;mu&#039;}" class="latex" /> produced by the randomized algorithm they construct. Then this says that no student can expect to gain more than <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ceta%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{&#92;eta}" title="{&#92;eta}" class="latex" /> utility by gaming the system. </p>
<p>
Confining the utility values to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5B0%2C1%5D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{[0,1]}" title="{[0,1]}" class="latex" /> ensures that any <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ceta+%3E+0%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{&#92;eta &gt; 0}" title="{&#92;eta &gt; 0}" class="latex" /> is larger than some differences if the number <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{m}" title="{m}" class="latex" /> of colleges is great enough, so this allows some slack compared to strict dominance which holds if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ceta+%3D+0%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{&#92;eta = 0}" title="{&#92;eta = 0}" class="latex" />. It also enables the utility values to be implicitly universally quantified in the condition by which <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ceta%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{&#92;eta}" title="{&#92;eta}" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Calpha%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{&#92;alpha}" title="{&#92;alpha}" class="latex" /> &#8220;mesh&#8221; with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{m}" title="{m}" class="latex" />, the number <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{n}" title="{n}" class="latex" /> of students, and the minimum capacity <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{C}" title="{C}" class="latex" /> of any college:</p>

This is an informal statement. The mechanism underlying the proof also works for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Calpha%2C%5Ceta%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{&#92;alpha,&#92;eta}" title="{&#92;alpha,&#92;eta}" class="latex" /> not fixed: provided <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{C}" title="{C}" class="latex" /> grows faster than <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csqrt%7Bm%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{&#92;sqrt{m}}" title="{&#92;sqrt{m}}" class="latex" />, the approximate stability and probable-approximate truth-telling dominance can be achieved with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Calpha%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{&#92;alpha}" title="{&#92;alpha}" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ceta%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{&#92;eta}" title="{&#92;eta}" class="latex" /> both tending toward <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{0}" title="{0}" class="latex" />. It is neat that the approximations are achieved using concepts and tools from differential privacy, which we have <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2015/02/06/cynthia-dwork-and-a-brilliant-idea/">posted</a> about <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2015/02/07/still-a-brilliant-idea/">before</a>.  By analogy with <a href="http://www.probablyapproximatelycorrect.com/">PAC</a>, we might summarize the whole system as being &#8220;probably approximately truthful.&#8221;</p>
<p>
<p><H2> Should We Handle Truth? </H2></p>
<p><p>
The notion of truth is fundamental. In logic the notion of <i>truth</i> as applied to mathematical theories is central to the Incompleteness Theorems of Kurt G&ouml;del and Alfred Tarski. </p>
<p>
In economics the notion of truth is different but perhaps even more important. Imagine any set of agents that are involved in some type of interaction: it could be a game, an auction, or some more complex type of interaction. Typically these agents make decisions, which affect not only what happens to them, but also to the other agents. In our &#8220;<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%2CB%2CC%2CD%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{A,B,C,D}" title="{A,B,C,D}" class="latex" />&#8221; example above, the further point is that &#8220;gaming the system&#8221; by <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{B}" title="{B}" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BD%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{D}" title="{D}" class="latex" /> lowered the utility for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{A}" title="{A}" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{C}" title="{C}" class="latex" />. But <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{A}" title="{A}" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{C}" title="{C}" class="latex" /> could have tried the same game.</p>
<p>
The effect on others highlights that this is a basic problem. It seems best when the interaction does not reward agents that essentially &#8220;lie&#8221; about their true interests. This speaks our desire for a system that rewards telling the truth&#8212;and takes the subject into the area of <em>algorithmic mechanism design</em> which we also featured in the post on Nisan. Indeed truth is addressed in his G&ouml;del Prize-winning <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~sandholm/cs15-892F15/selfishJ.pdf">paper</a> with Amir Ronen, for instance defining a mechanism to be <em>strongly truthful</em> if truth-telling is the <em>only</em> dominant strategy.</p>
<p>
That paper follows with a sub-sub-section 4.3.1 on &#8220;basic properties of truthful implementations&#8221;&#8212;but what I&#8217;m not finding in these papers are theorems that tell me <em>why</em> truthfulness is important in economic interactions. It sounds self evident, but is it? There are many papers that show one cannot force agents to be truthful, and there are other results showing cases in which the agents&#8217; individual best interests are to be truthful after all. I understand why a solution to a matching problem should be stable, but am not convinced that it needs to be truthful. In mathematics we can define a property that we add to restrict solutions to some problem, but we usually need to justify the property. If we are solving a equation, we may restrict the answers to be integers. The reason could be as simple as non-integer answers making no sense, such as buying 14.67 cans of Sprite for a party.</p>
<p>
I get that being truthful does stop some behavior that one might informally dislike. What I feel as an outsider to the research into matching problems is simple: where is the <em>theorem</em> that shows that adding truthful behavior has some advantage? It is true in the analogous case of auctions that they can be designed so that truthful bidding is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vickrey_auction#Proof_of_dominance_of_truthful_bidding">provably</a> a dominant strategy, and plausibly this matters to competitors agreeing to and paying for the auction mechanism. Perhaps there is a &#8220;meta&#8221; game level where mechanism designs are strategies and there is a communal payoff function, in which truth-inducing mechanism designs may be optimal strategies. But overall I am puzzled. Perhaps this just shows how naive I am about this line of work.</p>
<p>
<p>
<p><H2> Open Problems </H2></p>
<p><p>
What are your reactions on the importance of inducing truth-telling? To show at least dewy diligence on our part, here are <a href="http://publications.csail.mit.edu/publications/pubs/pdf/MIT-LCS-TR-913.pdf">a</a> <a href="http://www.parisschoolofeconomics.com/grenet-julien/WP/Fack_Grenet_He_2015.pdf">few</a> <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~ynaamad/pdf/anarchic-matching-jaamas.pdf">good</a> <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/~niederle/MatchingtheoryLecture.NRMPdesign.pdf">references</a>.  What would G&ouml;del&#8212;who conveyed certain of his own mechanism design <a href="http://morgenstern.jeffreykegler.com/">opinions</a> to his friend Oskar Morgenstern (no relation)&#8212;say?</p>

Noam Nisan has been one of the leaders in computational complexity and algorithms for many years. He has just been named the <a href="http://www.acm.org/media-center/2016/september/knuth-prize-2016">winner</a> of the 2016 Donald E. Knuth Prize. </p>
<p>
Today we congratulate Noam and highlight some of his recent contributions to algorithmic economics and complexity.<br />
<span id="more-13746"></span></p>
<p>
I (Dick) think that Noam missed out on proper recognition in the past. I am thrilled that he is finally recognized for his brilliant work. I do differ with the impression given by ACM&#8217;s headline. His game theory work is clearly important, but his <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Problems-Pseudorandom-Generators-Doctoral-Dissertation/dp/026264052X">early</a> <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/b038/6dce0af09b91f5b24393d294e7066323d44e.pdf">work</a> on pseudorandom generators was of first order. And personally I wonder if that almost alone would be enough to argue that Noam is one of the great leaders in complexity theory&#8212;let alone the work on communication complexity and interactive proofs. </p>
<p>
I (Ken) had forgotten that he was the &#8216;N&#8217; in the LFKN <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=146605">paper</a> with Carsten Lund, Lance Fortnow, and Howard Karloff proving that interactive proofs can simulate the polynomial hierarchy, which presaged the proof of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BIP+%3D+PSPACE%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{&#92;mathsf{IP = PSPACE}}" title="{&#92;mathsf{IP = PSPACE}}" class="latex" />. The first sentence of the ACM article does list these three complexity areas before mentioning game theory. There are others: Noam co-authored with Nathan Linial and Yishay Mansour a seminal 1993 <a href="http://www.ma.huji.ac.il/~ehudf/courses/anal09/LMN.pdf">paper</a> that promoted Fourier analysis to study Boolean circuits, and with Mario Szegedy a 1994 <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2508255_On_the_Degree_of_Boolean_Functions_as_Real_Polynomials">paper</a> on the polynomial method that impacted a host of topics including Boolean function sensitivity, decision trees, and quantum query lower bounds. </p>
<p>
<p><H2> Walking Around and Back </H2></p>
<p><p>
In what Lance once <a href="http://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2008/07/one-who-walked-away.html">termed</a> &#8220;walking away&#8221; from complexity, Noam in the mid-1990s became interested in algorithmic economics. Really we should say it is the interface between complexity and economics. We can say that theory&#8212;in particular mathematical game theory&#8212;frames much of this interface, but the business end of it is <em>social</em>. The genius we note in his seminal <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=301250.301287">paper</a> with Amir Ronen, titled &#8220;Algorithm Mechanism Design,&#8221; is in mapping the social elements to structures in distributed computation and communication theory (routing and protocols as well as communication complexity) that were already developed. This paper was one of three jointly <a href="http://www.acm.org/press-room/news-releases/2012/goedel-prize-2012/">awarded</a> the 2012 Gödel Prize. Regarding it, the Knuth citation says: </p>
<blockquote><p>
A mechanism is an algorithm or protocol that is explicitly designed so that rational participants, motivated purely by their self-interest, will achieve the designer&#8217;s goals. This is of paramount importance in the age of the Internet, with many applications from auctions to network routing protocols. Nisan has designed some of the most effective mechanisms by providing the right incentives to the players. He has also shown that in a variety of environments there is a tradeoff between economic efficiency and algorithmic efficiency.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
The last part of this addresses a question of more general import to us in theory:</p>

How much impact can complexity lower bounds and conditional hardness relationships have in the real world?
</p></blockquote>
<p>
The impact is helped along when the lower bounds come from communication complexity. Bounds on the number of bits that must be communicated to achieve a common goal (with high probability) are generally more concrete and easier to establish than those in the closed system of classical complexity theory, whose internal nature makes the most central bound questions asymptotic. </p>

Noam long ago co-authored the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Communication-Complexity-Eyal-Kushilevitz/dp/052102983X">textbook</a> <em>Communication Complexity</em> with Eyal Kushilevitz, and also co-edited the 2007 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Algorithmic-Game-Theory-Noam-Nisan/dp/0521872820">text</a> <em>Algorithmic Game Theory</em> with Tim Roughgarden, Éva Tardos, and Georgia Tech&#8217;s own Vijay Vazirani. The whole package of great breadth as well as depth in foundational areas, imbued with computer science education, ably fits the Knuth Prize profile. But we are going to make a forward-looking point by exploring how some of his recent joint papers reach a synthesis that includes some implications for complexity. </p>

<p><H2> Four Recent Papers </H2></p>

<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{&#92;bullet}" title="{&#92;bullet}" class="latex" /> &#8220;Public Projects, Boolean Functions, and the Borders of Border&#8217;s Theorem,&#8221; <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1504.07687v1.pdf">with</a> Parikhshit Gopalan and Tim Roughgarden, <a href="http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/sigecom/sigecom2015.html#GopalanNR15">in</a> the 2015 ACM Conference on Economics and Computation. Border&#8217;s Theorem is an instance where the feasible space of an exponential-sized linear program has a natural projection onto the space of a polynomial-sized one. The linear programs express allocations of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{m}" title="{m}" class="latex" />-many bid-for goods to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{n}" title="{n}" class="latex" /> bidders according to their expressed and private valuations of those goods. The paper shows complexity obstacles to extending this nice exponential-to-polynomial property to other economic situations.</p>
<p>
The overall subject can be read about in two sets of <a href="http://theory.stanford.edu/~tim/notes.html">lecture notes</a> by Roughgarden. We adapt an example from section 2 of this <a href="http://theory.stanford.edu/~tim/w14/l/l38.pdf">lecture</a> to give the flavor: Suppose you have 2 items for sale and one prospective buyer such that for each item there is a 50-50 chance the buyer is willing to pay $1 for it, but you lose $1 for each item you fail to sell (call it shelving cost). If you price each item at $1, you will expect to make one sale, reaping $1 but also losing $1 on the unsold item, for zero expected net revenue. That&#8217;s no better than if you gave each away for $0. If you set the price in-between, say $0.50, you will expect a net loss&#8212;because the buyer&#8217;s probability distribution of value is discrete not smooth. But if you bundle them at 2-for-$1, you will expect to sell the bundle three-fourths of the time, for expected net revenue ($1 + $1 + $1 &#8211; $2)/4 = $0.25, which is positive. </p>
<p>
Our change from Roughgarden&#8217;s prices and values of $1,$2 is meant to convey that problems about (random) Boolean functions and set systems are lurking here. Suppose we have <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{n}" title="{n}" class="latex" /> items; what is the optimal bundling strategy? Grouping them at $2-for-4 expects to net the same $0.125 per item as the above grouping $1-for-2. But grouping $1-for-3 expects to reap $1 seven-eights of the time and lose $3 one-eighth of the time, for $4/8 = $0.50 net for 3 items, which gives a slightly better $0.167 per item. Is this optimal? We could write a big linear program to tell&#8212;also in situations with other prices and distributions of buyer values and conditions. </p>
<p>
In several of these situations, they show that a Border-like theorem would put a <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7B%5C%23P%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{&#92;mathsf{&#92;#P}}" title="{&#92;mathsf{&#92;#P}}" class="latex" />-hard problem into <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP%5E%7BNP%7D%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{&#92;mathsf{P^{NP}}}" title="{&#92;mathsf{P^{NP}}}" class="latex" /> and hence collapse the polynomial hierarchy. A technical tool for later results in the paper is the expectation <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Chat%7Bf%7D_0%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{&#92;hat{f}_0}" title="{&#92;hat{f}_0}" class="latex" /> of a Boolean function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{f}" title="{f}" class="latex" /> over a random assignment and for each <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bi%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{i}" title="{i}" class="latex" /> the expectation <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Chat%7Bf%7D_i%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{&#92;hat{f}_i}" title="{&#92;hat{f}_i}" class="latex" /> of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28-1%29%5E%7B1+-+x_i%7Df%28x%29%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{(-1)^{1 - x_i}f(x)}" title="{(-1)^{1 - x_i}f(x)}" class="latex" />, which constitute the zeroth and first-degree coefficients of the Fourier transform of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{f}" title="{f}" class="latex" />.

Imagine a situation where buyers will only buy pairs of items in bundles. We can make an undirected graph whose nodes are the items and each edge is weighted by the price the buyer is willing to pay. Graph theory supplies tools to analyze the resulting markets, while behavior for special kinds of graphs may yield insights about the structure of problems involving them.</p>

A bijection <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmu%3A+%5Bn%5D+%5Crightarrow+%5Bn%5D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{&#92;mu: [n] &#92;rightarrow [n]}" title="{&#92;mu: [n] &#92;rightarrow [n]}" class="latex" /> is <em>unstable</em> if there exist <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bi%2Cj+%5Cin+%5Bn%5D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{i,j &#92;in [n]}" title="{i,j &#92;in [n]}" class="latex" /> such that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm_i%28j%29+%3E+m_i%28%5Cmu%28i%29%29%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{m_i(j) &gt; m_i(&#92;mu(i))}" title="{m_i(j) &gt; m_i(&#92;mu(i))}" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bw_j%28i%29+%3E+w_j%28%5Cmu%5E%7B-1%7D%28j%29%29%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{w_j(i) &gt; w_j(&#92;mu^{-1}(j))}" title="{w_j(i) &gt; w_j(&#92;mu^{-1}(j))}" class="latex" />, otherwise it is <i>stable</i>. Figuratively, the latter inequality means that woman <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bj%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{j}" title="{j}" class="latex" /> prefers man <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bi%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{i}" title="{i}" class="latex" /> to her own husband and the former means that man <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bi%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{i}" title="{i}" class="latex" /> likewise prefers woman <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bj%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{j}" title="{j}" class="latex" /> to his own wife. There always exist &#8220;marriage functions&#8221; <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmu%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{&#92;mu}" title="{&#92;mu}" class="latex" /> that are stable, but the problem is to find one.</p>
<p>
This is a classic example of a problem whose best-known algorithms run in time order-of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%5E2%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{n^2}" title="{n^2}" class="latex" /> in worst case, but <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28n%5Clog+n%29%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{O(n&#92;log n)}" title="{O(n&#92;log n)}" class="latex" /> time in average case for permutations generated uniformly at random. This random model may not reflect &#8220;practical case&#8221; however, so the worst-case time merits scrutiny for possible improvement, perhaps under some helpful conditions. One avenue of improvement is not to require reading the whole input, whose size when the permutations are listed out is already order-of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%5E2%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{n^2}" title="{n^2}" class="latex" /> (ignoring a log factor by treating elements of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Bn%5D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{[n]}" title="{[n]}" class="latex" /> as unit size), but rather allow random access to selected bits. These queries can be comparisons <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bw_i%28j%29+%3E+w_k%28%5Cell%29%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{w_i(j) &gt; w_k(&#92;ell)}" title="{w_i(j) &gt; w_k(&#92;ell)}" class="latex" /> or more general. The paper finds a powerful new reduction from the communication complexity of disjointness (if Alice and Bob each hold an <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{n}" title="{n}" class="latex" />-bit binary string, verify there is no index <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bi%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{i}" title="{i}" class="latex" /> where each string has a <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{1}" title="{1}" class="latex" />) into preference-based problems to prove the query number must be <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5COmega%28n%5E2%29%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{&#92;Omega(n^2)}" title="{&#92;Omega(n^2)}" class="latex" /> even for randomized algorithms and even with certain extra helpful conditions. </p>

The <em>sensitivity</em> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bs%28f%29%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{s(f)}" title="{s(f)}" class="latex" /> of (a family of) <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{n}" title="{n}" class="latex" />-variable Boolean functions <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{f}" title="{f}" class="latex" /> is the minimum over <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{x}" title="{x}" class="latex" /> of the number of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{y}" title="{y}" class="latex" /> adjacent to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{x}" title="{x}" class="latex" /> such that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%28y%29+%5Cneq+f%28x%29%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{f(y) &#92;neq f(x)}" title="{f(y) &#92;neq f(x)}" class="latex" />. Here adjacent means <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{x}" title="{x}" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{y}" title="{y}" class="latex" /> differ in one bit. The functions are <em>smooth</em> if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bs%28f%29+%3D+%28%5Clog+n%29%5E%7BO%281%29%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{s(f) = (&#92;log n)^{O(1)}}" title="{s(f) = (&#92;log n)^{O(1)}}" class="latex" />, or variously, if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bs%28f%29+%3D+n%5E%7Bo%281%29%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{s(f) = n^{o(1)}}" title="{s(f) = n^{o(1)}}" class="latex" />. One way to achieve <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bs%28f%29+%5Cleq+d%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{s(f) &#92;leq d}" title="{s(f) &#92;leq d}" class="latex" /> is for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{f}" title="{f}" class="latex" /> to be computed by a depth-<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{d}" title="{d}" class="latex" /> decision tree, since along each branch determined by an <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{x}" title="{x}" class="latex" /> there are at most <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{d}" title="{d}" class="latex" /> bits on which the branch&#8217;s assigned value depends. Noam, first solo and then in the 1994 paper with Szegedy, conjectured a kind of converse: there is a universal constant <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{c}" title="{c}" class="latex" /> such that every <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{f}" title="{f}" class="latex" /> has a decision tree of depth <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bs%28f%29%5Ec%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{s(f)^c}" title="{s(f)^c}" class="latex" />. </p>
<p>
Decision trees are broadly more powerful in corresponding depth and size measures than Boolean circuits, which in turn are more powerful than formulas. Although belief in Noam&#8217;s conjecture has grown, no one had determined upper bounds for circuits and formulas. The paper gives circuits of size <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28n%5E%7Bs%28f%29%7D%29%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{O(n^{s(f)})}" title="{O(n^{s(f)})}" class="latex" /> and formulas of depth <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28s%28f%29%5Clog+n%29%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{O(s(f)&#92;log n)}" title="{O(s(f)&#92;log n)}" class="latex" /> with somewhat laxer size <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%5E%7BO%28s%28f%29%29%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{n^{O(s(f))}}" title="{n^{O(s(f))}}" class="latex" />. The size is scarcely the same as a polynomial in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bs%28f%29%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{s(f)}" title="{s(f)}" class="latex" />, but it&#8217;s a start, and when <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bs%28f%29%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{s(f)}" title="{s(f)}" class="latex" /> is polylog, the size is quasipolynomial and the depth is polylog. This most-recent paper will hopefully jump-start work on proving the conjecture and fundamental work on Boolean functions.</p>

Sarah Cannon is a current PhD student in our Algorithms, Combinatorics, and Optimization program working with Dana Randall. Sarah has a newly-updated <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.07991">paper</a> with Dana and Joshua Daymude and Andrea Richa entitled, &#8220;A Markov Chain Algorithm for Compression in Self-Organizing Particle Systems.&#8221;  An earlier <a href="http://delivery.acm.org/10.1145/2940000/2933107/p279-cannon.pdf?ip=128.205.34.109&amp;id=2933107&amp;acc=OPENTOC&amp;key=7777116298C9657D%2ED5883A64E01CCB16%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E9F04A3A78F7D3B8D&amp;CFID=670965286&amp;CFTOKEN=89212775&amp;__acm__=1474841262_196d00c171d3fdb502df3fe3513570d0">version</a> was presented at PODC 2016. </p>
<p>
Today Ken and I would like to discuss the paper, and relate it to some recent results on soft robots.<br />
<span id="more-13727"></span></p>
<p>
For starters let&#8217;s call the paper (CDRR)&#8212;after the authors last names. Being lazy let me also start by quoting part of their abstract:</p>
<blockquote><p>
We consider programmable matter as a collection of simple computational elements (or particles) with limited (constant-size) memory that self-organize to solve system-wide problems of movement, configuration, and coordination. Here, we focus on the compression problem, in which the particle system gathers as tightly together as possible, as in a sphere or its equivalent in the presence of some underlying geometry. More specifically, we seek fully distributed, local, and asynchronous algorithms that lead the system to converge to a configuration with small perimeter. We present a Markov chain based algorithm that solves the compression problem under the geometric amoebot model, for particle systems that begin in a connected configuration with no holes.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
What does this mean? They imagine simple devices that lie on a 2-dimensional lattice. Each device operates in with the same rules: they can decide what to do next based only on their local environment; however, the devices have access to randomness. The goal is that the devices over time should tend, with high probability, to form a tightly grouped system. This is what they call the <i>compression</i> problem. The <i>surprise</i> is that even with only local interactions, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{n}" title="{n}" class="latex" /> such devices can form a configuration that close to as tight a configuration as possible. Roughly they will collapse into a region of perimeter order at most <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28%5Csqrt%7Bn%7D%29%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{O(&#92;sqrt{n})}" title="{O(&#92;sqrt{n})}" class="latex" />. </p>
<p>
<p><H2> Soft Robots </H2></p>
<p><p>
As I started to write this post, I discovered that are some neat results on <i>soft robots</i>. As usual, theorists like CDRR think about <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{n}" title="{n}" class="latex" /> objects. They study the behavior of many simple devices and prove theorems that hold often for large enough <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{n}" title="{n}" class="latex" />. Their main one, as a stated above, is that there are devices that can solve the compression problem and get within a region of perimeter order <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28%5Csqrt%7Bn%7D%29%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{O(&#92;sqrt{n})}" title="{O(&#92;sqrt{n})}" class="latex" />.</p>
<p>
On the other hand, practical researchers often start by studying the case of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%3D1%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{n=1}" title="{n=1}" class="latex" />. I think both ends of the spectrum are important, and they complement each other. Since I am not a device physicist, I will just point out the highlights of the recent work on soft robots. </p>

<a href="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/poland.png"><img src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/poland.png?w=300&#038;h=210" alt="poland" width="300" height="210" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-13728" /></a></p>

The above photo is of a &#8220;light-powered micro-robot capable of mimicking the slow, steady crawl of an inchworm or small caterpillar.&#8221; See <a href="https://www.fuw.edu.pl/press-release/news4657.html">this</a> for more details. </p>
<p>
This is research done by a team in Poland led by Piotr Wasylczyk, who writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Designing soft robots calls for a completely new paradigm in their mechanics, power supply and control. We are only beginning to learn from nature and shift our design approaches towards these that emerged in natural evolution.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Their soft robot is based on no motors or pneumatic actuators to make it move. Instead it uses a clever liquid crystal elastomer technology: when exposed to light the device moves like a caterpillar. Further the light can be adjusted to make the device move in different ways. </p>
<p>
I have no idea if this work can be extended to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%3E1%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{n&gt;1}" title="{n&gt;1}" class="latex" />, nor could it be used to implement even small numbers of the devices that CDRR require. I thought you might enjoy hearing about such creepy devices. Let&#8217;s turn to the mathematical work on the compression problem. </p>
<p>
<p><H2> The Model </H2></p>
<p><p>
CDRR assume that they have a fixed structure, which is an infinite undirected graph. Their devices or particles sit on the vertices of this structure. This, of course, forces the particles to be a discrete system. As you might guess, the usual structures are fixed lattices. These lattices have periodic structure that makes the systems that result at least possible to understand. Even with this regular structure the global behavior of their particles can be quite subtle.</p>
<p>
The models of this type have various names; the one they use is called the <em>amoebot</em> model as proposed in this 2014 <a href="http://sops.cs.upb.de/publications/DDG14.pdf">paper</a>. I like to think of them as soft robots creeping along the lattice.</p>
<p><a href="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/worm.png"><img src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/worm.png?w=108&#038;h=120" alt="worm" width="108" height="120" class="aligncenter wp-image-13729" /></a></p>
<p>
Okay the above is a cartoon. Here are some more-illustrative figures from the 2014 paper:</p>
<p><a href="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/bot1.png"><img src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/bot1.png?w=600&#038;h=155" alt="bot1"   class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-13730" /></a></p>
<p>
Their &#8220;particles&#8221; reside in a triangular lattice and either sit at one vertex or occupy two adjacent vertices. Figuratively, the worm is either pulled together or is stretched out. They can creep to an adjacent vertex by stretching out and later contracting. They cannot hop as in Chinese checkers.</p>
<p>
<p><H2> The Worms Cannot Play Go </H2></p>
<p><p>
We don&#8217;t know if the game of Go can be played sensibly on a Chinese checkers board, but anyway these worms cannot play Go. A necessity in Go is forming interior holes called <em>eyes</em>. Although the movement rules crafted by CDRR are entirely local and randomized, the configuration of worms can never make an eye.</p>
<p>
Let <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{a}" title="{a}" class="latex" /> be a node occupied by a contracted worm <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{P}" title="{P}" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bb%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{b}" title="{b}" class="latex" /> an adjacent empty node. Then let <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{c}" title="{c}" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{d}" title="{d}" class="latex" /> be the two nodes adjacent to both <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{a}" title="{a}" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bb.%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{b.}" title="{b.}" class="latex" />  Define the neighborhood <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN_%7Ba%2Cb%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{N_{a,b}}" title="{N_{a,b}}" class="latex" /> to include <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{c}" title="{c}" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd%2C%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{d,}" title="{d,}" class="latex" />, the other three nodes adjacent to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{a}" title="{a}" class="latex" />, and the other three nodes adjacent to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bb%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{b}" title="{b}" class="latex" />. Here is an alternate version of the rules in CDRR for it to be legal for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{P}" title="{P}" class="latex" /> to expand into <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bb%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{b}" title="{b}" class="latex" /> and then contract into <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bb%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{b}" title="{b}" class="latex" />:</p>
<ol>
<li>
If both <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc%2Cd%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{c,d}" title="{c,d}" class="latex" /> are occupied, then all occupied nodes in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN_%7Ba%2Cb%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{N_{a,b}}" title="{N_{a,b}}" class="latex" /> must be connected within <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN_%7Ba%2Cb%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{N_{a,b}}" title="{N_{a,b}}" class="latex" /> to either <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{c}" title="{c}" class="latex" /> or <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{d}" title="{d}" class="latex" /> but not both.</p>
<li>
If one of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc%2Cd%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{c,d}" title="{c,d}" class="latex" /> is occupied, then all occupied nodes in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN_%7Ba%2Cb%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{N_{a,b}}" title="{N_{a,b}}" class="latex" /> must be connected within <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN_%7Ba%2Cb%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{N_{a,b}}" title="{N_{a,b}}" class="latex" /> to it. </p>
<li>
If neither is occupied, then the occupied neighbors of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{a}" title="{a}" class="latex" /> must form one connected component within <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN_%7Ba%2Cb%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{N_{a,b}}" title="{N_{a,b}}" class="latex" />, and so must the neighbors of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bb%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{b}" title="{b}" class="latex" />.
</ol>
<p>
There are further rules saying initially that no node in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN_%7Ba%2Cb%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{N_{a,b}}" title="{N_{a,b}}" class="latex" /> may be part of an expanded worm and covering possible adjacent expanded worms after <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{P}" title="{P}" class="latex" /> has expanded. However, their effect is to enable treating the nodes concerned as unoccupied, so that Markov chains <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{M}" title="{M}" class="latex" /> built on these rules need only use states with all worms contracted. The rules are enforceable by giving each worm a fixed finite local memory that its neighbors can share.</p>
<p>
The &#8220;not both&#8221; in the first rule subsumes their rule that the worm cannot have five occupied neighbors, which would cause an eye upon its moving to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bb%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{b}" title="{b}" class="latex" />. The second and third rules preserve connectedness of the whole and ensure that the move does not connect islands at <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bb%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{b}" title="{b}" class="latex" />. The third rule also ensures that a path of open nodes through <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc%2Cb%2Cd%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{c,b,d}" title="{c,b,d}" class="latex" /> now can go <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc%2Ca%2Cd%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{c,a,d}" title="{c,a,d}" class="latex" />. The rules&#8217; symmetry makes a subsequent move back from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bb%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{b}" title="{b}" class="latex" /> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{a}" title="{a}" class="latex" /> also legal, so that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{M}" title="{M}" class="latex" /> reversible. </p>
<p>
Their chain <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{M}" title="{M}" class="latex" /> always executes the move if the number <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt_a%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{t_a}" title="{t_a}" class="latex" /> of triangles the worm was part of on node <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{a}" title="{a}" class="latex" /> is no greater than the number <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt_b%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{t_b}" title="{t_b}" class="latex" /> of triangles it joins on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bb%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{b}" title="{b}" class="latex" />, and otherwise happens with probability <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Clambda%5E%7Bt_b+-+t_a%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{&#92;lambda^{t_b - t_a}}" title="{&#92;lambda^{t_b - t_a}}" class="latex" /> where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Clambda+%3E+1%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{&#92;lambda &gt; 1}" title="{&#92;lambda &gt; 1}" class="latex" /> is a fixed constant. Given the rules, it strikes us that using the difference in neighbor counts as the exponent is equivalent.  The whole system is concurrent and asynchronous, but <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{M}" title="{M}" class="latex" /> is described by first choosing one worm uniformly at random for a possible move at each step, and then choosing an unoccupied neighbor at random.</p>
<p><p>
<H2> Example and Main Theorems </H2></p>
<p><p>
Here is a configuration from their paper in which the only legal moves involve the third rule:</p>

<p><P><br />
The edges denote adjacent contracted worms, not expanded worms. Suppose the chosen node <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{a}" title="{a}" class="latex" /> is the one midway up the second column at left. It forms a triangle with its two neighbors to the left, so <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt_a+%3D+1.%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{t_a = 1.}" title="{t_a = 1.}" class="latex" /> The node <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bb%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{b}" title="{b}" class="latex" /> above <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{a}" title="{a}" class="latex" /> is vacant, but moving there would close off a big region below it. The move is prevented by the second rule because <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN_%7Ba%2Cb%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{N_{a,b}}" title="{N_{a,b}}" class="latex" /> would comprise four nodes that are not all connected within <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN_%7Ba%2Cb%7D.%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{N_{a,b}.}" title="{N_{a,b}.}" class="latex" /> Similarly the node below <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{a}" title="{a}" class="latex" /> is forbidden. Either node <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bb%27%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{b&#039;}" title="{b&#039;}" class="latex" /> to the right of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{a}" title="{a}" class="latex" /> is permitted by rule 3, however. Since <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt_%7Bb%27%7D+%3D+2%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{t_{b&#039;} = 2}" title="{t_{b&#039;} = 2}" class="latex" /> the move will certainly happen if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bb%27%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{b&#039;}" title="{b&#039;}" class="latex" /> is randomly chosen. </p>
<p>
This suggests there could be examples where the only legal moves go back and forth, creating cycles as can happen in John Conway&#8217;s game of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life">Life</a>. However, CDRR show that every connected hole-free <i>n</i>-worm configuration is reachable from any other. This makes the Markov chain <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{M}" title="{M}" class="latex" /> <em>ergodic</em>. Their main theorem is:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Theorem 1</b> <em> For all <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Calpha+%3E+1%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{&#92;alpha &gt; 1}" title="{&#92;alpha &gt; 1}" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Clambda+%3E+%282+%2B+%5Csqrt%7B2%7D%29%5E%7B%5Calpha%2F%28%5Calpha+-+1%29%7D%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{&#92;lambda &gt; (2 + &#92;sqrt{2})^{&#92;alpha/(&#92;alpha - 1)}}" title="{&#92;lambda &gt; (2 + &#92;sqrt{2})^{&#92;alpha/(&#92;alpha - 1)}}" class="latex" />, and sufficiently large <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{n}" title="{n}" class="latex" />, when <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{M}" title="{M}" class="latex" /> is run from any connected, hole-free <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{n}" title="{n}" class="latex" />-worm configuration, with all but exponentially vanishing probability it reaches and stays among configurations with total perimeter at most <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Calpha%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{&#92;alpha}" title="{&#92;alpha}" class="latex" /> times the minimum possible perimeter for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{n}" title="{n}" class="latex" /> nodes. </em></p></blockquote>
<p><p>
The second main theorem shows a threshold of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Clambda+%3C+2.172033%5Cdots%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{&#92;lambda &lt; 2.172033&#92;dots}" title="{&#92;lambda &lt; 2.172033&#92;dots}" class="latex" /> for the opposite behavior: the perimeter stays at size <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5COmega%28n%29%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{&#92;Omega(n)}" title="{&#92;Omega(n)}" class="latex" />. </p>
<p>
<p><H2> The Proof </H2></p>
<p><p>
The researchers CDRR are experts at the analysis of Markov chains. So they view their particles as such a system. Then they need to prove that the resulting Markov system behaves the way they claim: that as time increases they tend to form a tight unit that solves the compression problem. </p>
<p>
Luckily there are many analytical tools at their disposal. But regarding the ergodicity alone, they say:</p>
<blockquote><p>
We emphasize the details of this proof are far from trivial, and occupy the next ten pages.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Their particles are pretty simple, but to prove that the system operates as claimed requires quite careful analysis. Take a look at their paper for the details.</p>
<p>
I (Dick) will make one last detailed comment. They want their system to operate completely locally. This means that there can be no global clock: each particles operates asynchronously. This requires some clever ideas to make it work: they want each particle to activate in an random manner. They use the trick that random sequences of actions can be approximated using Poisson clocks with mean <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1.%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{1.}" title="{1.}" class="latex" />  The key is:</p>
<blockquote><p>
After each action, a particle then computes another random time drawn from the same distribution and executes again after that amount of time has elapsed. The exponential distribution is unique in that, if particle <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{P}" title="{P}" class="latex" /> has just activated, it is equally likely that any particle will be the next particle to activate, including particle <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{P}" title="{P}" class="latex" />. Moreover, the particles update without requiring knowledge of any of the other particles&#8217; clocks. Similar Poisson clocks are commonly used to describe physical systems that perform updates in parallel in continuous time.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
<p><H2> Open Problems </H2></p>
<p><p>
After looking at their paper in some depth, we find the result that local independent particles can actually work together to solve a global problem remains intriguing. Yes there are many such results but they usually have global clocks and other assumptions. The fact that compression is achievable by a weaker model is very neat. </p>

Wilhelm Ackermann was a mathematician best known for work in constructive aspects of logic. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ackermann_function">Ackermann function</a> is named after him.  It is used both in complexity theory and in data structure theory. That is a pretty neat combination.</p>
<p>
I would like today to talk about a proof of the famous Halting Problem.<br />
<span id="more-13711"></span></p>
<p>
This term at Georgia Tech I am teaching CS4510, which is the introduction to complexity theory. We usually study general Turing machines and then use the famous Cantor Diagonal method to show that the Halting Problem is not computable. My students over the years have always had trouble with this proof. We have discussed this method multiple times: see <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2009/04/18/cantors-non-diagonal-proof/">here</a> and <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2010/06/11/does-cantors-diagonalization-proof-cheat/">here</a> and <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2011/10/29/poker-and-cantors-proof/">here</a> and in motion pictures <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2013/01/19/cantors-theorem-the-movie/">here</a>.</p>
<p>
This leads always to the question, what really is a proof? The formal answer is that it is a derivation of a theorem statement in a sound and appropriate system of logic. But as reflected in our last <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2016/09/04/how-hard-really-is-sat/">two</a> <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2016/08/28/descending-proofs-into-algorithms/">posts</a>, such a proof might not help human understanding. The original meaning of &#8220;proof&#8221; in Latin was the same as &#8220;probe&#8221;&#8212;to test and explore. I mean &#8220;proof of the Halting Problem&#8221; in this sense. We think the best proofs are those that show a <em>relationship</em> between concepts that one might not have thought to juxtapose.</p>
<p>
<p><H2> Diagonal and Impossible </H2></p>
<p><p>
The question is how best to convince students that there is no way to compute a halting function. We can define Turing machines <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM_x%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{M_x}" title="{M_x}" class="latex" /> in a particular way&#8212;or define other kinds of machines. Then we get the particular definition </p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++H%28x%2Cy%29+%3D+1+%5Ctext%7B+if+the+machine+%7D+M_x+%5Ctext%7B+halts+on+input+%7D+y%3B%5C%3B%5C%3B+H%28x%2Cy%29+%3D+0+%5Ctext%7B+otherwise.%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="&#92;displaystyle  H(x,y) = 1 &#92;text{ if the machine } M_x &#92;text{ halts on input } y;&#92;;&#92;; H(x,y) = 0 &#92;text{ otherwise.}" title="&#92;displaystyle  H(x,y) = 1 &#92;text{ if the machine } M_x &#92;text{ halts on input } y;&#92;;&#92;; H(x,y) = 0 &#92;text{ otherwise.}" class="latex" /></p>
<p>
How can we prove that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BH%28x%2Cy%29%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{H(x,y)}" title="{H(x,y)}" class="latex" /> is not computable? We want to convey not only that this particular <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BH%28x%2Cy%29%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{H(x,y)}" title="{H(x,y)}" class="latex" /> is uncomputable, but also that <em>no function like it</em> is computable. </p>
<p>
Trying the diagonal method means first defining the set </p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++D+%3D+%5C%7Bx%3A+M_x+%5Ctext%7B+does+not+accept+%7D+x%5C%7D.+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="&#92;displaystyle  D = &#92;{x: M_x &#92;text{ does not accept } x&#92;}. " title="&#92;displaystyle  D = &#92;{x: M_x &#92;text{ does not accept } x&#92;}. " class="latex" /></p>
<p>
We need to have already defined what &#8220;accept&#8221; means. OK, we show that there is no machine <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM_d%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{M_d}" title="{M_d}" class="latex" /> whose set of accepted strings equals <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BD%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{D}" title="{D}" class="latex" />. Then what? We can say that the complementary language <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BK+%3D+%5C%7Bx%3A+M_x+%5Ctext%7B+%5Cemph%7Bdoes%7D+accept+%7D+x%5C%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{K = &#92;{x: M_x &#92;text{ &#92;emph{does} accept } x&#92;}}" title="{K = &#92;{x: M_x &#92;text{ &#92;emph{does} accept } x&#92;}}" class="latex" /> is not decidable, but we still need <em>another</em> step to conclude that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BH%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{H}" title="{H}" class="latex" /> is uncomputable. And when you trace back the reason, you have to fall back on the diagonal contradiction&#8212;which feels disconnected and <em>ad hoc</em> to the particular way <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BD%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{D}" title="{D}" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BH%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{H}" title="{H}" class="latex" /> are defined.</p>
<p>
Ken in his classes goes the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BD%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{D}" title="{D}" class="latex" /> route <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2014/11/26/cornell-cs-at-50/">first</a>, but Sipser&#8217;s and several other common textbooks try to hit <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BH%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{H}" title="{H}" class="latex" /> directly. The targeted <em>reason</em> is one that anyone can grab:</p>
<blockquote><p>
It is <b>impossible</b> for a function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{f}" title="{f}" class="latex" /> to give the value <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%28n%29+%3D+f%28n%29+%2B+1%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{f(n) = f(n) + 1}" title="{f(n) = f(n) + 1}" class="latex" />&#8212;or any greater value.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Implementations of this, however, resort to double loops to define <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%28n%29%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{f(n)}" title="{f(n)}" class="latex" />. Or like Sipser&#8217;s they embed the &#8220;<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BD%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{D}" title="{D}" class="latex" />&#8221; idea in the proof anyway, which strikes us as making it harder than doing separate steps as above. We want the cleanest way.</p>
<p>
<p><H2> The Proof </H2></p>
<p><p>
Here is the plan. As usual we need to say that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM_%7Bx%7D%28y%29%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{M_{x}(y)}" title="{M_{x}(y)}" class="latex" /> represents a computation. If the computation halts then it returns a result. We <b>allow</b> the machine <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM_%7Bx%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{M_{x}}" title="{M_{x}}" class="latex" /> to return an integer, not just accept or reject. If the machine does not halt then we can let this value be undefined; our point will be that by &#8220;short-circuit&#8221; reasoning the question of an undefined value won&#8217;t even enter.</p>
<p>
Now let <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BH%28x%2Cy%29%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{H(x,y)}" title="{H(x,y)}" class="latex" /> be defined as the halting function above. </p>
<blockquote><p><b>Theorem 1</b> <em> The function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BH%28x%2Cy%29%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{H(x,y)}" title="{H(x,y)}" class="latex" /> is not computable.<br />
</em>
</p></blockquote>
<p><p>
<em>Proof:</em>  Define the function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%28y%29%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{f(y)}" title="{f(y)}" class="latex" /> as follows: </p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++f%28y%29+%3D+1+%2B+%5Csum_%7Bx%3D0%7D%5E%7By%7D+H%28x%2Cy%29+%5Ccdot+M_%7Bx%7D%28y%29.+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="&#92;displaystyle  f(y) = 1 + &#92;sum_{x=0}^{y} H(x,y) &#92;cdot M_{x}(y). " title="&#92;displaystyle  f(y) = 1 + &#92;sum_{x=0}^{y} H(x,y) &#92;cdot M_{x}(y). " class="latex" /></p>
<p>
Suppose that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BH%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{H}" title="{H}" class="latex" /> is computable. Then so is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%28y%29%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{f(y)}" title="{f(y)}" class="latex" />. This is easy to see: just do the summation and when computing <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BH%28x%2Cy%29+%5Ccdot+M_%7Bx%7D%28y%29%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{H(x,y) &#92;cdot M_{x}(y)}" title="{H(x,y) &#92;cdot M_{x}(y)}" class="latex" /> compute the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BH%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{H}" title="{H}" class="latex" /> part first. If it is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{0}" title="{0}" class="latex" /> then it adds nothing to the summation, so it &#8220;short-circuits&#8221; <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM_%7Bx%7D%28y%29%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{M_{x}(y)}" title="{M_{x}(y)}" class="latex" /> and we move on to the next <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{y}" title="{y}" class="latex" />. If it is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{1}" title="{1}" class="latex" /> then we compute <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM_%7Bx%7D%28y%29%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{M_{x}(y)}" title="{M_{x}(y)}" class="latex" /> and add that to the summation. Let <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA_y+%3D+%5Csum_%7Bx%3D0%7D%5E%7By+-+1%7D+H%28x%2Cy%29+%5Ccdot+M_%7Bx%7D%28y%29%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{A_y = &#92;sum_{x=0}^{y - 1} H(x,y) &#92;cdot M_{x}(y)}" title="{A_y = &#92;sum_{x=0}^{y - 1} H(x,y) &#92;cdot M_{x}(y)}" class="latex" /> stand for the summation before the last <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx+%3D+y%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{x = y}" title="{x = y}" class="latex" /> term; then <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA_y+%5Cgeq+0%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{A_y &#92;geq 0}" title="{A_y &#92;geq 0}" class="latex" />.</p>
<p>
Now if the theorem is false, then there must be some <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{n}" title="{n}" class="latex" /> such that the machine <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM_n%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{M_n}" title="{M_n}" class="latex" /> computes <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%28y%29%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{f(y)}" title="{f(y)}" class="latex" />. But then </p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++f%28n%29+%3D+1+%2B+%5Csum_%7Bx%3D0%7D%5En+H%28x%2Cn%29M_%7Bx%7D%28n%29+%3D+1+%2B+A_n+%2B+M_%7Bn%7D%28n%29+%5Cge+1+%2B+M_%7Bn%7D%28n%29+%3D+1+%2B+f%28n%29.+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="&#92;displaystyle  f(n) = 1 + &#92;sum_{x=0}^n H(x,n)M_{x}(n) = 1 + A_n + M_{n}(n) &#92;ge 1 + M_{n}(n) = 1 + f(n). " title="&#92;displaystyle  f(n) = 1 + &#92;sum_{x=0}^n H(x,n)M_{x}(n) = 1 + A_n + M_{n}(n) &#92;ge 1 + M_{n}(n) = 1 + f(n). " class="latex" /></p>
<p>
This is impossible and so the theorem follows. <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CBox&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="&#92;Box" title="&#92;Box" class="latex" /></p>
<p>
<p><H2> Extending Simplicity </H2></p>
<p><p>
What Ken and I are really after is relating this to hierarchies in complexity classes. When the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM_%7Bx%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{M_{x}}" title="{M_{x}}" class="latex" /> are machines of a complexity class <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BC%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{&#92;mathsf{C}}" title="{&#92;mathsf{C}}" class="latex" /> then the functions <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BH%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{H}" title="{H}" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{f}" title="{f}" class="latex" /> <b>are</b> computable. It follows that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{f}" title="{f}" class="latex" /> is not computed by any <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM_n%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{M_n}" title="{M_n}" class="latex" /> and so does not belong to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BC%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{&#92;mathsf{C}}" title="{&#92;mathsf{C}}" class="latex" />. What we want is to find similar functions <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%27%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{f&#039;}" title="{f&#039;}" class="latex" /> that are natural.</p>
<p>
Ackermann&#8217;s famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ackermann_function">function</a> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%28n%29%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{A(n)}" title="{A(n)}" class="latex" /> does this when <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BC%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{&#92;mathsf{C}}" title="{&#92;mathsf{C}}" class="latex" /> is the class of primitive recursive functions. There are various ways to define the machines <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM_%7Bx%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{M_{x}}" title="{M_{x}}" class="latex" />, for instance by programs with counted loops only. The <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%28n%29%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{f(n)}" title="{f(n)}" class="latex" /> that tumbles out is not primitive recursive&#8212;indeed it out-grows all primitive recursive functions. Showing that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%28n%29%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{A(n)}" title="{A(n)}" class="latex" /> does likewise takes a little more formal work. </p>
<p>
In complexity theory we have various time and space hierarchy theorems, say where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BC%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{&#92;mathsf{C}}" title="{&#92;mathsf{C}}" class="latex" /> is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BDTIME%7D%5BO%28n%5E2%29%5D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{&#92;mathsf{DTIME}[O(n^2)]}" title="{&#92;mathsf{DTIME}[O(n^2)]}" class="latex" />. For any <em>time constructible</em> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%28n%29+%3D+%5Comega%28n%5E2+%5Clog+n%29%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{t(n) = &#92;omega(n^2 &#92;log n)}" title="{t(n) = &#92;omega(n^2 &#92;log n)}" class="latex" />, we can separate <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BC%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{&#92;mathsf{C}}" title="{&#92;mathsf{C}}" class="latex" /> from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BC%27+%3D+DTIME%7D%5Bt%28n%29%5D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{&#92;mathsf{C&#039; = DTIME}[t(n)]}" title="{&#92;mathsf{C&#039; = DTIME}[t(n)]}" class="latex" /> by a &#8220;slowed&#8221; diagonalization. The <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%27%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{f&#039;}" title="{f&#039;}" class="latex" /> obtained this way, however, needs knowledge of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%28n%29%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{t(n)}" title="{t(n)}" class="latex" /> and its constructibility to define it. By further &#8220;padding&#8221; and &#8220;translation&#8221; steps, one can laboriously make it work for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%28n%29+%3D+%5Comega%28n%5E2+%28%5Clog+n%29%5E%7B%5Cepsilon%7D%29%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{t(n) = &#92;omega(n^2 (&#92;log n)^{&#92;epsilon})}" title="{t(n) = &#92;omega(n^2 (&#92;log n)^{&#92;epsilon})}" class="latex" />, for any fixed <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cepsilon+%3E+0%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{&#92;epsilon &gt; 0}" title="{&#92;epsilon &gt; 0}" class="latex" />, and a similar theorem for deterministic space needs no log factors at all. This is all technical in texts and lectures.</p>
<p>
Suppose we&#8217;re happy with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BC%27+%3D+DTIME%7D%5Bn%5E3%5D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{&#92;mathsf{C&#039; = DTIME}[n^3]}" title="{&#92;mathsf{C&#039; = DTIME}[n^3]}" class="latex" />, that is, with a non-&#8220;tight&#8221; hierarchy. Can we simply find a natural <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%27%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{f&#039;}" title="{f&#039;}" class="latex" /> that works for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BC%27%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{&#92;mathsf{C&#039;}}" title="{&#92;mathsf{C&#039;}}" class="latex" />? Or suppose <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BC%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{&#92;mathsf{C}}" title="{&#92;mathsf{C}}" class="latex" /> is a combined time and space class, say machines that run in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28n%5E2%29%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{O(n^2)}" title="{O(n^2)}" class="latex" /> time and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28n%29%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{O(n)}" title="{O(n)}" class="latex" /> space simultaneously. Can we possibly get a natural <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BC%27%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{&#92;mathsf{C&#039;}}" title="{&#92;mathsf{C&#039;}}" class="latex" /> that is different from what <em>we</em> get by considering time or space separately?</p>
<p>
We&#8217;d like the &#8220;non-tight&#8221; proofs to be simple enough to combine with the above proof for halting. This leads into another change we&#8217;d like to see. Most textbooks define computability several chapters ahead of complexity, so the latter feels like a completely different topic. Why should this be so? It is easy to define the length and space usage of a computation in the same breath. Even when finite automata are included in the syllabus, why not present them as special cases of Turing machines and say they run in linear time, indeed time <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%2B1%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{n+1}" title="{n+1}" class="latex" />? </p>
<p>
<p><H2> Open Problems </H2></p>
<p><p>
Is the above Halting Problem proof clearer than the usual ones? Or is it harder to follow? </p>
<p>
What suggestions would you make for updating and tightening theory courses?

<p>
Marijn Heule, Oliver Kullmann, and Victor Marek are experts in practical SAT solvers. They recently used this ability to solve a longstanding problem popularized by Ron Graham.</p>
<p>
Today Ken and I want to discuss their work and ask a question about its ramifications.<br />
<span id="more-13696"></span></p>
<p>
The <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.00723">paper</a> by them&#8212;we will call it and them HKM&#8212;is titled, &#8220;Solving and Verifying the boolean Pythagorean Triples problem via Cube-and-Conquer.&#8221; The triples problem is a &#8220;Ramsey&#8221;-like question raised years ago by Graham. Cube-and-Conquer is a method for solving large and complex SAT problems. Sandwiched in between is a clever new tuning of <em>resolution</em> SAT methods called &#8220;DRAT&#8221; which we discuss in some detail.</p>
<p>
<p><H2> The Pythagorean Triples Problem </H2></p>
<p><p>
Ron was interested in a problem that generalizes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schur's_theorem#Ramsey_theory">Schur&#8217;s Theorem</a>, due to Issai Schur. Suppose we color the numbers <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5C%7B1%2C%5Cdots%2CN%5C%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{&#92;{1,&#92;dots,N&#92;}}" title="{&#92;{1,&#92;dots,N&#92;}}" class="latex" /> red and green. Can we always find <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%2Cb%2Cc%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{a,b,c}" title="{a,b,c}" class="latex" /> three distinct numbers of the same color so that 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++a+%2B+b+%3D+c%3F&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="&#92;displaystyle  a + b = c?" title="&#92;displaystyle  a + b = c?" class="latex" /></p>
<p>
Schur&#8217;s theorem says that provided <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{N}" title="{N}" class="latex" /> is large enough this is true.

Several mathematicians independently proved the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folkman's_theorem">extension</a> that there are arbitrarily large sets <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{S}" title="{S}" class="latex" /> with this property&#8212;indeed for any number of colors: </p>

<p>
All the sums of course are linear. What happens if we go to higher powers <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{p}" title="{p}" class="latex" />? </p>
<p>
If we simply look at <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{p}" title="{p}" class="latex" />-th powers of sums from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{S}" title="{S}" class="latex" /> then we tie into the same theorem via <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cchi%27%28x%29+%3D+%5Cchi%28x%5Ep%29%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{&#92;chi&#039;(x) = &#92;chi(x^p)}" title="{&#92;chi&#039;(x) = &#92;chi(x^p)}" class="latex" /> for all <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{x}" title="{x}" class="latex" />. Taking sums of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{p}" title="{p}" class="latex" />-th powers such as <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%5Ep+%2B+b%5Ep%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{a^p + b^p}" title="{a^p + b^p}" class="latex" /> is different. We can map that case into the simple sums problem with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%27+%3D+%5C%7Ba%5Ep%2Cb%5Ep%5C%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{S&#039; = &#92;{a^p,b^p&#92;}}" title="{S&#039; = &#92;{a^p,b^p&#92;}}" class="latex" /> in place of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS+%3D+%5C%7Ba%2Cb%5C%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{S = &#92;{a,b&#92;}}" title="{S = &#92;{a,b&#92;}}" class="latex" />, but it is not clear how to argue similarly with mapped colorings <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cchi%27%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{&#92;chi&#039;}" title="{&#92;chi&#039;}" class="latex" />. Sets of the form <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%27%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{S&#039;}" title="{S&#039;}" class="latex" /> are special.</p>
<p>
We can make them even more special by requiring <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%5Ep+%2B+b%5Ep%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{a^p + b^p}" title="{a^p + b^p}" class="latex" /> to be a perfect <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{p}" title="{p}" class="latex" />-th power too. OK, for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp+%5Cgeq+3%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{p &#92;geq 3}" title="{p &#92;geq 3}" class="latex" /> we are kidding, but the case <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp+%3D+2%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{p = 2}" title="{p = 2}" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm+%3D+2%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{m = 2}" title="{m = 2}" class="latex" /> is the famous one of Pythagorean triples. Suppose we color the numbers <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5C%7B1%2C%5Cdots%2CN%5C%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{&#92;{1,&#92;dots,N&#92;}}" title="{&#92;{1,&#92;dots,N&#92;}}" class="latex" /> red and green. Can we always find three distinct numbers <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%2Cb%2Cc%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{a,b,c}" title="{a,b,c}" class="latex" /> <em>of the same color</em> so that </p>

This is the question Ron asked. In the spirit of Paul Erd&#337;s, he offered $100 for a solution.</p>
<p>
The answer from HKM is that this extension is true. Perhaps that is not too surprising, since many problems can be generalized from from linear to non-linear cases. But what is really perhaps the most interesting part is that HKM found a proof via using SAT solvers. </p>
<p>
<p><H2> The Theorem </H2></p>
<p><p>
The exact theorem HKM prove is:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Theorem 1</b> <em> The set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5C%7B1%2C%5Cdots%2C7824%5C%7D%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{&#92;{1,&#92;dots,7824&#92;}}" title="{&#92;{1,&#92;dots,7824&#92;}}" class="latex" /> can be partitioned into two parts, such that no part contains a Pythagorean triple, while this is impossible for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5C%7B1%2C%5Cdots%2C7825%5C%7D%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{&#92;{1,&#92;dots,7825&#92;}}" title="{&#92;{1,&#92;dots,7825&#92;}}" class="latex" />. </em></p></blockquote>
<p><p>
Note, this shows that Schur&#8217;s theorem does extend from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%2Bb%3Dc%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{a+b=c}" title="{a+b=c}" class="latex" /> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%5E%7B2%7D%2Bb%5E%7B2%7D%3Dc%5E%7B2%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}}" title="{a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}}" class="latex" />.</p>
<p>
What is special about <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B7%2C%5C%21825%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{7,&#92;!825}" title="{7,&#92;!825}" class="latex" />?

<p>
There are five distinct entries for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc+%3D+7%2C%5C%21820%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{c = 7,&#92;!820}" title="{c = 7,&#92;!820}" class="latex" />, various others before it, and quite a few for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B7%2C%5C%21830%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{7,&#92;!830}" title="{7,&#92;!830}" class="latex" /> after it.

It seems better to think of it as a tipping point. </p>
<p>
<p><H2> The Proof </H2></p>
<p><p>
There are <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%5E%7B7%2C%5C%21825%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{2^{7,&#92;!825}}" title="{2^{7,&#92;!825}}" class="latex" /> colorings for the numbers up to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B7%2C%5C%21825%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{7,&#92;!825}" title="{7,&#92;!825}" class="latex" />. This immediately stops any simple brute-force approach. What must be done is to break the immense number of cases down to a more manageable number. HKM did this by clever use of known SAT methods with at the addition of heuristics that are tailored to this question. </p>
<p>
The previous best positive result had been a 2-coloring of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5B1+..+7%2C%5C%21664%5D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{[1 .. 7,&#92;!664]}" title="{[1 .. 7,&#92;!664]}" class="latex" /> with no monochromatic triple, so HKM had a good idea of how large an <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{N}" title="{N}" class="latex" /> to try. The SAT encoding is simple: use variables <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx_i%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{x_i}" title="{x_i}" class="latex" /> for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2+%5Cleq+i+%5Cleq+N%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{2 &#92;leq i &#92;leq N}" title="{2 &#92;leq i &#92;leq N}" class="latex" />, and for every <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28a%2Cb%2Cc%29%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{(a,b,c)}" title="{(a,b,c)}" class="latex" /> such that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%5E2+%2B+b%5E2+%3D+c%5E2%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{a^2 + b^2 = c^2}" title="{a^2 + b^2 = c^2}" class="latex" />, include the clauses </p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%28x_a+%5Cvee+x_b+%5Cvee+x_c%29+%5Cwedge+%28%5Cbar%7Bx%7D_a+%5Cvee+%5Cbar%7Bx%7D_b+%5Cvee+%5Cbar%7Bx%7D_c%29.+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="&#92;displaystyle  (x_a &#92;vee x_b &#92;vee x_c) &#92;wedge (&#92;bar{x}_a &#92;vee &#92;bar{x}_b &#92;vee &#92;bar{x}_c).

<p>
If we give <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx_i+%3D+1%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{x_i = 1}" title="{x_i = 1}" class="latex" /> the meaning that the number <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bi%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{i}" title="{i}" class="latex" /> is colored green, then this says that for every Pythagorean triple, at least one member must be green and at least one must be red. 3SAT remains NP-complete for clauses of all-equal sign, as follows by tweaking the proof at the end of this <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2013/10/10/proving-cooks-theorem/">post</a>. </p>
<p>
Now with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN+%3D+7%2C%5C%21825%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{N = 7,&#92;!825}" title="{N = 7,&#92;!825}" class="latex" />, what HKM needed to do was to prove the formula <em>un</em>satisfiable. Proving satisfiability is easy when you know or guess a satisfying assignment&#8212;in this case, a coloring. The following graphic from the <em>Nature</em> <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/two-hundred-terabyte-maths-proof-is-largest-ever-1.19990">article</a> on their work shows a coloring for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B7%2C%5C%21824%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{7,&#92;!824}" title="{7,&#92;!824}" class="latex" /> in which the white squares are &#8220;don&#8217;t-cares&#8221;&#8212;they can be either color:</p>

<p>
The top row goes 24 squares; the cell after them is the sticking point. How to prove there is no consistent way to color it?

The general idea, roughly speaking, is to <em>add</em> more clauses <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{C}" title="{C}" class="latex" /> to make a formula <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%27%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{F&#039;}" title="{F&#039;}" class="latex" /> so that:</p>

Besides good guesses for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{N}" title="{N}" class="latex" />, HKM were armed with the latest knowledge on well-performing heuristics. A 2012 <a href="https://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/mjarvisa/papers/jarvisalo-heule-biere.ijcar12.pdf">paper</a> by Matti J&auml;rvisalo with Heule and Armin Biere includes an overview of resolution-related properties involving a big array of acronyms such as AT and HBC and RHT. The AT stands for &#8220;asymmetric tautology&#8221; and the &#8216;R&#8217; prefix applied to a formula property <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{P}" title="{P}" class="latex" /> enlarges <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{P}" title="{P}" class="latex" /> by adding cases where a certain kind of resolution yields a formula with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{P}" title="{P}" class="latex" />. Combining these two yields the following definition&#8212;we paraphrase the newer paper&#8217;s version informally:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Definition 2</b> <em><a name="RAT"></a> Given a formula <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{F}" title="{F}" class="latex" /> and a clause <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{C}" title="{C}" class="latex" /> not in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{F}" title="{F}" class="latex" />, say <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{C}" title="{C}" class="latex" /> has RAT via a literal <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bz%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{z}" title="{z}" class="latex" /> in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{C}" title="{C}" class="latex" /> if for all clauses <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BD%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{D}" title="{D}" class="latex" /> of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{F}" title="{F}" class="latex" /> containing <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbar%7Bz%7D%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{&#92;bar{z}}" title="{&#92;bar{z}}" class="latex" /> the following happens: when you make the other literals in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{C}" title="{C}" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BD%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{D}" title="{D}" class="latex" /> false, remove <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BD%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{D}" title="{D}" class="latex" />, and simplify, you get an immediate contradiction. </em></p></blockquote>
<p><p>
We should say more about &#8220;simplify&#8221;: Suppose <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bz_1%2C%5Cdots%2Cz_k%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{z_1,&#92;dots,z_k}" title="{z_1,&#92;dots,z_k}" class="latex" /> are those other literals. Making them false is the same as making the formula </p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+%7BF_0+%3D+F+%5Csetminus+%5C%7BD%5C%7D+%5Cwedge+%5Cbar%7Bz%7D_1+%5Cwedge+%5Ccdots+%5Cwedge%5Cbar%7Bz%7D_k%2C%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="&#92;displaystyle {F_0 = F &#92;setminus &#92;{D&#92;} &#92;wedge &#92;bar{z}_1 &#92;wedge &#92;cdots &#92;wedge&#92;bar{z}_k,}" title="&#92;displaystyle {F_0 = F &#92;setminus &#92;{D&#92;} &#92;wedge &#92;bar{z}_1 &#92;wedge &#92;cdots &#92;wedge&#92;bar{z}_k,}" class="latex" /></p>
<p>
which has their negations as <em>unit clauses</em>. We simplify by removing for each <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bi%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{i}" title="{i}" class="latex" /> all clauses with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bz_i%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{z_i}" title="{z_i}" class="latex" /> (those were satisfied) and deleting <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbar%7Bz%7D_i%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{&#92;bar{z}_i}" title="{&#92;bar{z}_i}" class="latex" /> from other clauses. After doing this, there may be other unit clauses, whereupon we repeat. If we get both <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{y}" title="{y}" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbar%7By%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{&#92;bar{y}}" title="{&#92;bar{y}}" class="latex" /> for some variable <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{y}" title="{y}" class="latex" />, that&#8217;s the immediate contradiction we seek. What&#8217;s important is that this <em>unit resolution</em> process, while &#8220;logically&#8221; inferior to full resolution, stops in polynomial time.</p>
<p>
Now suppose <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{F}" title="{F}" class="latex" /> <b>is</b> satisfiable and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{C}" title="{C}" class="latex" /> has RAT via <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bz%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{z}" title="{z}" class="latex" />. If there is a satisfying assignment <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{a}" title="{a}" class="latex" /> of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{F}" title="{F}" class="latex" /> that sets <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bz%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{z}" title="{z}" class="latex" /> or one of the other literals in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{C}" title="{C}" class="latex" /> true, then <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%27+%3D+F+%5Cwedge+C%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{F&#039; = F &#92;wedge C}" title="{F&#039; = F &#92;wedge C}" class="latex" /> is also satisfied. So suppose <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{a}" title="{a}" class="latex" /> sets them all false. Now there must exist a clause <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BD%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{D}" title="{D}" class="latex" /> in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{F}" title="{F}" class="latex" /> containing <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbar%7Bz%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{&#92;bar{z}}" title="{&#92;bar{z}}" class="latex" /> such that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{a}" title="{a}" class="latex" /> sets the other literals in that clause false&#8212;if none then we could have set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bz%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{z}" title="{z}" class="latex" /> true after all. Then <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF_0%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{F_0}" title="{F_0}" class="latex" /> above is satisfied by <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{a}" title="{a}" class="latex" />, but this is a contradiction of the (immediate) contradiction. </p>
<p>
Note also that if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%27+%3D+F+%5Cwedge+C%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{F&#039; = F &#92;wedge C}" title="{F&#039; = F &#92;wedge C}" class="latex" /> is satisfiable then of course so is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{F}" title="{F}" class="latex" />. This isn&#8217;t important to the unsatisfiability proof but is good to know: RAT clauses can be added freely. The trick is to <em>find</em> them. Definition <a href="#RAT">2</a> was crafted to make it polynomial-time recognizable that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{C}" title="{C}" class="latex" /> is RAT when you have it, but you still have to find it. A particularly adept choice of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{C}" title="{C}" class="latex" /> may allow simplifications that delete other clauses, yielding a technique called <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~marijn/publications/drat-trim.pdf">DRAT</a> for &#8220;Deletion Resolution Asymmetric Tautology&#8221; proofs.</p>
<p>
This is where the other ingenious heuristics&#8212;tailored for the triples problem but following a general paradigm called &#8220;cube-and-conquer&#8221;&#8212;come in. We&#8217;ll refer those details to the paper and its references, but this breakthrough should make one excited to read more about the state of the art.</p>
<p>
<p><H2> Dart the Art? </H2></p>
<p><p>
The problem took &#8220;only&#8221; two days of computing on a supercomputer&#8212;the Texas Advanced Computing Center. The computation generated 200 terabytes of raw text output. It is not clear to us whether even more intermediate text was generated on-the-fly as unsuccessful moves were backtracked-out, or how much. HKM say in their abstract:</p>
<blockquote><p>
&#8230;Due to the general interest in this mathematical problem, our result requires a formal proof. Exploiting recent progress in unsatisfiability proofs of SAT solvers, we produced and verified a proof in the DRAT format, which is almost 200 terabytes in size. From this we extracted and made available a compressed certificate of 68 gigabytes, that allows anyone to reconstruct the DRAT proof for checking.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
As with all computer proofs we still would like a human-readable proof. It is not that we do not trust the validity of the current proof, but rather that we would like to &#8220;understand&#8221; if possible <em>why</em> Ron&#8217;s problem is answered. Can we possibly extract from the certificate a <em>dart</em> of reasoning that yields a shorter explanation? It might be a numerical potential function whose values <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bv%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{v}" title="{v}" class="latex" /> in this case are guessable and verifiable, such that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bv+%3E+t%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{v &gt; t}" title="{v &gt; t}" class="latex" /> for some threshold <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{t}" title="{t}" class="latex" /> analytically implies unsatisfiability.</p>
<p>
We also wonder why the size-<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{N}" title="{N}" class="latex" /> formulas treated here should be any more difficult than ones you can get for factoring <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{N}" title="{N}" class="latex" />-bit numbers. As we noted above, the all-signs-equal condition on the literals comes without loss of generality. So the degree of ease that allowed solving on a university center in two days must come from how the Pythagorean pattern gave a leg up to &#8220;cube-and-conquer.&#8221; For factoring there might be other legs&#8212;and the &#8220;<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{N}" title="{N}" class="latex" />&#8221; from current security standards might yield even smaller formulas.</p>
<p>
Last, as noted in the papers we&#8217;ve linked, the DART condition has universality properties with regard to resolution in general, yet builds on steps that are in polynomial-time <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%28n%29%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{p(n)}" title="{p(n)}" class="latex" />. It was an incremental liberalization of previously used steps, and this makes us wonder whether it can be enhanced further while still yielding proofs that take up <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bg%28n%29p%28n%29%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{g(n)p(n)}" title="{g(n)p(n)}" class="latex" /> length and time. Perhaps we can get the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bg%28n%29%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{g(n)}" title="{g(n)}" class="latex" /> part to be <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%5E%7Bo%28n%29%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{2^{o(n)}}" title="{2^{o(n)}}" class="latex" />? That would refute some forms of the &#8220;Exponential Time Hypothesis,&#8221; which we last discussed <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2015/06/01/puzzling-evidence/">here</a>.</p>
<p>
<p><H2> Open Problems </H2></p>
<p><p>
The most immediate questions raised by this wonderful work are: what about other equations, and what about allowing more colors? Does having three colors zoom the problem beyond any hope of attack by today&#8217;s computers, or will the practical breakthroughs continue a virtuous cycle with advances in theory that bring more cases into the realm of feasibility? Is there an asymptotic analysis that might guide our ability to forecast this?</p>

Nicholas Saunderson was the fourth Lucasian Professor at Cambridge, two after Isaac Newton. He promoted Newton&#8217;s <em>Principia Mathematica</em> in the Cambridge curriculum but channeled his original work into lecture notes and treatises rather than published papers. After his death, most of his work was collected into one <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=xq8rAQAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">book</a>, <em>The Elements of Algebra in Ten Books</em>, whose title recalls Euclid&#8217;s <em>Elements</em>. It includes what is often credited as the first &#8220;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Euclidean_algorithm">extended</a>&#8221; version of Euclid&#8217;s algorithm.</p>
<p>
Today we raise the idea of using algorithms such as this as the basis for proofs.<br />
<span id="more-13681"></span></p>
<p>
Saunderson was blind from age one. He built a machine for doing what he called &#8220;Palpable Arithmetic&#8221; by touch. As described in the same book, it was an enhanced abacus&#8212;not a machine for automated calculation of the kind a later Lucasian professor, Charles Babbage, attempted to build. </p>
<p>
We take the &#8220;palpable&#8221; idea metaphorically. Not only beginning students but we ourselves still find proofs by contradiction or &#8220;infinite descent&#8221; hard to pick up at first reading. We wonder how far mathematics can be developed so that the hard nubs of proofs are sheathed in assertions about the availability and correctness of algorithms. The algorithm&#8217;s proof may still involve contradiction, but there&#8217;s a difference: You can interact with an algorithm. It is hard to interact with a contradiction.</p>
<p>
<p><H2> An Example </H2></p>
<p><p>
It was known long before Euclid that the square root of 2 is irrational. In the terms Saunderson used, the diagonal of a square is &#8220;incommensurable&#8221; with its side. </p>
<p>
Alexander Bogomolny&#8217;s great educational <a href="http://www.cut-the-knot.org/">website</a> <em>Cut the Knot</em> has an entire <a href="http://www.cut-the-knot.org/proofs/">section</a> on proofs. Its coverage of the irrationality of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csqrt%7B2%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{&#92;sqrt{2}}" title="{&#92;sqrt{2}}" class="latex" /> itemizes twenty-eight <a href="http://www.cut-the-knot.org/proofs/sq_root.shtml">proofs</a>. All seem to rely on some type of infinite descent: if there is a rational solution then there is a smaller one and so on. Or they involve a contradiction of a supposition whose introduction seems perfunctory rather than concrete. We gave a proof by induction in a <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2010/12/20/some-mathematical-gifts/">post</a> some years ago, where we also noted a MathOverflow <a href="http://mathoverflow.net/questions/32011/direct-proof-of-irrationality">thread</a> and a <a href="https://gowers.wordpress.com/2010/03/28/when-is-proof-by-contradiction-necessary/">discussion</a> by Tim Gowers about this example. </p>
<p>
We suspect that one reason the proof of this simple fact is considered hard for a newcomer is just that it uses these kinds of descent and suppositions. Certainly the fact itself was considered veiled in antiquity. According to legend the followers of Pythagoras treated it as an official secret and murdered Hippasus of Metapontum for the crime of divulging it. To state it truly without fear today, we still want a clear view of <em>why</em> the square root of 2 is irrational.</p>
<p>
Our suggestion below is to avoid the descent completely. Of course it is used somewhere, but it is encapsulated in another result. The result is that for any co-prime integers <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{r}" title="{r}" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bs%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{s}" title="{s}" class="latex" /> there are integers <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{x}" title="{x}" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{y}" title="{y}" class="latex" /> such that </p>

Q.E.D.</p>
<p>
<HR></p>
<p><P><br />
The cited propositions are that two fractions in lowest whole-number terms must be identical and that if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{a}" title="{a}" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bb%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{b}" title="{b}" class="latex" /> are co-prime to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{c}" title="{c}" class="latex" /> then so is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bab%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{ab}" title="{ab}" class="latex" />. The proof of the latter starts with the for-contradiction words &#8220;if this be denied,&#8221; so the absence of such language above gets only part credit. This all does not come trippingly off the tongue; rather it sticks trippingly in the throat. Let&#8217;s try again.</p>
<p>
<p><H2> A Proof </H2></p>
<p><p>
In fact, we don&#8217;t need the concepts of &#8220;lowest terms&#8221; or co-primality or the full statement of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bezout's_identity">identity</a> named for &Eacute;tienne B&eacute;zout. It suffices to assert that for any whole numbers <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{r}" title="{r}" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bs%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{s}" title="{s}" class="latex" />, there are integers <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{x}" title="{x}" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{y}" title="{y}" class="latex" /> such that the number </p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++d+%3D+rx+%2B+sy+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="&#92;displaystyle  d = rx + sy " title="&#92;displaystyle  d = rx + sy " class="latex" /></p>
<p>
divides both <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{r}" title="{r}" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bs%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{s}" title="{s}" class="latex" />. This is what the extended Euclidean algorithm gives you. </p>
<p>
Then for the proof, suppose that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csqrt%7Bn%7D+%3D+%5Cfrac%7Br%7D%7Bs%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{&#92;sqrt{n} = &#92;frac{r}{s}}" title="{&#92;sqrt{n} = &#92;frac{r}{s}}" class="latex" /> for integers <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{r}" title="{r}" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bs%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{s}" title="{s}" class="latex" />. We take <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{x}" title="{x}" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{y}" title="{y}" class="latex" />, and let <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br_0+%3D+r%2Fd%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{r_0 = r/d}" title="{r_0 = r/d}" class="latex" />, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bs_0+%3D+s%2Fd%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{s_0 = s/d}" title="{s_0 = s/d}" class="latex" /> be the resulting integers. Now let&#8217;s do some simple algebra: </p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++r_0+x+%2B+s_0+y+%3D+1%2C%5Cquad%5Ctext%7Bso%7D%5Cquad+r_0+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B1+-s_0+y%7D%7Bx%7D%2C%5Cquad%5Ctext%7Bso%7D%5Cquad+x%5E2r_0%5E2+%3D+%281+-+s_0+y%29%5E2%3B+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="&#92;displaystyle  r_0 x + s_0 y = 1,&#92;quad&#92;text{so}&#92;quad r_0 = &#92;frac{1 -s_0 y}{x},&#92;quad&#92;text{so}&#92;quad x^2r_0^2 = (1 - s_0 y)^2; " title="&#92;displaystyle  r_0 x + s_0 y = 1,&#92;quad&#92;text{so}&#92;quad r_0 = &#92;frac{1 -s_0 y}{x},&#92;quad&#92;text{so}&#92;quad x^2r_0^2 = (1 - s_0 y)^2; " class="latex" /></p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++n+%3D+%5Cfrac%7Br%5E2%7D%7Bs%5E2%7D+%3D+%5Cfrac%7Br_0%5E2%7D%7Bs_0%5E2%7D%2C%5Cquad%5Ctext%7Bso%7D%5Cquad+r_0%5E2+%3D+s_0%5E2+n.+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="&#92;displaystyle  n = &#92;frac{r^2}{s^2} = &#92;frac{r_0^2}{s_0^2},&#92;quad&#92;text{so}&#92;quad r_0^2 = s_0^2 n. " title="&#92;displaystyle  n = &#92;frac{r^2}{s^2} = &#92;frac{r_0^2}{s_0^2},&#92;quad&#92;text{so}&#92;quad r_0^2 = s_0^2 n. " class="latex" /></p>
<p>
It follows that </p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++x%5E2+s_0%5E2+n+%3D+%281+-+s_0+y%29%5E2+%3D+1+-+2s_0+y+%2B+s_0%5E2+y%5E2.+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="&#92;displaystyle  x^2 s_0^2 n = (1 - s_0 y)^2 = 1 - 2s_0 y + s_0^2 y^2. " title="&#92;displaystyle  x^2 s_0^2 n = (1 - s_0 y)^2 = 1 - 2s_0 y + s_0^2 y^2. " class="latex" /></p>
<p>
Now divide both sides of this by <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bs_0%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{s_0}" title="{s_0}" class="latex" />. We get </p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7Bs_0%7D+%3D+2y+%2B+s_0+x%5E2+n+-+s_0+y%5E2+%3D+%5Ctext%7Bsome+integer%7D.+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="&#92;displaystyle  &#92;frac{1}{s_0} = 2y + s_0 x^2 n - s_0 y^2 = &#92;text{some integer}. " title="&#92;displaystyle  &#92;frac{1}{s_0} = 2y + s_0 x^2 n - s_0 y^2 = &#92;text{some integer}. " class="latex" /></p>
<p>
The conclusion is that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bs_0+%3D+1%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{s_0 = 1}" title="{s_0 = 1}" class="latex" />, hence <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bs+%3D+d%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{s = d}" title="{s = d}" class="latex" />. Thus <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csqrt%7Bn%7D+%3D+%5Cfrac%7Br%7D%7Bd%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{&#92;sqrt{n} = &#92;frac{r}{d}}" title="{&#92;sqrt{n} = &#92;frac{r}{d}}" class="latex" />. But <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{d}" title="{d}" class="latex" /> also divides <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{r}" title="{r}" class="latex" />. So <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csqrt%7Bn%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{&#92;sqrt{n}}" title="{&#92;sqrt{n}}" class="latex" /> is an integer&#8212;the same end as the classical proof.</p>
<p>
This is a contradiction. But it is a palpable contradiction. For instance, of course we can see that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csqrt%7B2%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{&#92;sqrt{2}}" title="{&#92;sqrt{2}}" class="latex" /> isn&#8217;t an integer. Thus we claim that the effect of this proof is more concrete.</p>
<p>
<p><H2> Open Problems </H2></p>
<p><p>
Is this a new proof? We doubt it. But the proof is nice in that it avoids any recursion or induction. The essential point&#8212;the divisibility of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{d}" title="{d}" class="latex" /> into <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{r}" title="{r}" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bs%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{s}" title="{s}" class="latex" />&#8212;is coded into the Euclidean algorithm. </p>
<p>
Is ours at least smoother than the classical proof we quoted? The latter is from Saunderson&#8217;s <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=xq8rAQAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=surd&amp;f=false">book</a>, on pages 304&#8211;305 which come soon after his presentation of the algorithm on pages 295&#8211;298.</p>
<p>
What other proofs can benefit from similar treatment by &#8220;reduction to algorithms&#8221;?</p>

<p><a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2016/08/14/a-surprise-for-big-data-analytics/landweberlazarpatel/" rel="attachment wp-att-13676"><img src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/landweberlazarpatel.png?w=300&#038;h=138" alt="LandweberLazarPatel" width="300" height="138" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-13676" /></a></p>
<p>
Peter Landweber, Emanuel Lazar, and Neel Patel are mathematicians. I have never worked with Peter Landweber, but have written papers with Larry and Laura Landweber. Perhaps I can add Peter one day.
<p>
Today I want to report on a recent result on the fiber structure of continuous maps.</p>
<p><span id="more-13653"></span></p>
<p>
The <a href="http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~mlazar/fibers.pdf">paper</a> by Landweber, Lazar, and Patel (LLP) is titled, &#8220;On The Fiber Diameter Of Continuous Maps.&#8221; Pardon me, but I assume that some of you may not be familiar with the fiber of a map. Fiber has nothing to do with the content of food or diets, for example. Fibers are a basic property of a map.</p>
<p>
Their title does not give away any suggestion that their result is relevant to those studying data sets. Indeed even their full abstract only says at the end:</p>
<blockquote><p>
 <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdots%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{&#92;dots}" title="{&#92;dots}" class="latex" /> <i>Applications to data analysis are considered.</i>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
I just became aware of their result from reading a recent Math Monthly issue. The paper has a number of interesting results&#8212;all with some connection to data analytics. I must add that I had not seen it earlier because of a recent move, and the subsequent lack of getting US mail. Moves are disruptive&#8212;Bob Floyd used to tell me that &#8220;two moves equal a fire&#8221;&#8212;and I&#8217;ve just moved twice. Oh well.</p>
<p>
<h2> The Result </h2>
<p><p>
The <b>fiber</b> of a map <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{f}" title="{f}" class="latex" /> at <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{y}" title="{y}" class="latex" /> is the set of points <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{x}" title="{x}" class="latex" /> so that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%28x%29%3Dy%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{f(x)=y}" title="{f(x)=y}" class="latex" />. The diameter of a fiber is just what you would expect: the maximum distance of the points in the fiber. LLP prove this&#8212;they say they have a &#8220;surprisingly short proof&#8221; and give earlier sources for it at the end of their paper:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Theorem: </b> <em> Let <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf+%5Ccolon+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5E%7Bn%7D+%5Crightarrow+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5E%7Bm%7D%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{f &#92;colon &#92;mathbb{R}^{n} &#92;rightarrow &#92;mathbb{R}^{m}}" title="{f &#92;colon &#92;mathbb{R}^{n} &#92;rightarrow &#92;mathbb{R}^{m}}" class="latex" /> be a continuous function where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn+%3E+m%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{n &gt; m}" title="{n &gt; m}" class="latex" />. Then for any <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM+%3E+0%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{M &gt; 0}" title="{M &gt; 0}" class="latex" />, there exists <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By+%5Cin+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5Em%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{y &#92;in &#92;mathbb{R}^m}" title="{y &#92;in &#92;mathbb{R}^m}" class="latex" /> whose fiber has diameter greater than <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{M}" title="{M}" class="latex" />. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
<p><h2> The Proof </h2>
<p><p>
The following figure from their paper conveys the essence of the proof in the case <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm+%3D+1%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{m = 1}" title="{m = 1}" class="latex" />:</p>
<p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2016/08/14/a-surprise-for-big-data-analytics/fiber/" rel="attachment wp-att-13658"><img src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/fiber.png?w=600" alt="fiber" width="600" class="aligncenter  wp-image-13658" /></a></p>
<p>
For <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm+%3E+1%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{m &gt; 1}" title="{m &gt; 1}" class="latex" /> one might expect a difficult dimension-based agument. However, they leverage whatever difficult reasoning went into the following theorem by Karol Borsuk and Stanislaw Ulam. We have mentioned both of them multiple times on this blog but never this theorem:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Theorem:</b> <em> Let <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{f}" title="{f}" class="latex" /> be any continuous function from the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{m}" title="{m}" class="latex" />-sphere to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5Em%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{&#92;mathbb{R}^m}" title="{&#92;mathbb{R}^m}" class="latex" />. Then there are antipodal points that give the same value, i.e., some <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{x}" title="{x}" class="latex" /> on the sphere such that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%28x%29+%3D+f%28-x%29%7D&#038;bg=e8e8e8&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{f(x) = f(-x)}" title="{f(x) = f(-x)}" class="latex" />. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p><p>
The proof then simply observes that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{m}" title="{m}" class="latex" />-spheres of radius <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{M}" title="{M}" class="latex" /> live inside <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5En%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{&#92;mathbb{R}^n}" title="{&#92;mathbb{R}^n}" class="latex" /> for any <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn+%3E+m%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{n &gt; m}" title="{n &gt; m}" class="latex" />, and arbitrarily large <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{M}" title="{M}" class="latex" />. The antipodal points belong to the same fiber of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{f}" title="{f}" class="latex" /> but are <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2M%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{2M}" title="{2M}" class="latex" /> apart.</p>
<p>
<h2> What It Means For Data Scientists </h2>
<p><p>
Why should we care about this theorem? That&#8217;s a good question. </p>
<p>
One of the main ideas in analytics is to reduce the dimension of a set of data. If we let the data lie in a Euclidean space, say <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5E%7Bn%7D%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{&#92;mathbb{R}^{n}}" title="{&#92;mathbb{R}^{n}}" class="latex" />, then we may wish to map the data down to a space of lower dimension. This yields lots of obvious advantages&#8212;the crux is that we can do many computational things on lower-dimensional data that would be too expensive on the original <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{n}" title="{n}" class="latex" />-dimensional space. </p>
<p>
The LLP result shows that no matter what the mapping is, as long as it is continuous, there must be points that are far apart in the original space and yet get map to the exactly same point in the lower space. This is somewhat annoying: clearly it means there will always be points that the map does not classify correctly. </p>
<p>
<h2> Open Problems </h2>
<p><p>
One of the issues I think raised by this work on LLP is that within areas like big-data people can work on it from many angles. I think that we do not always see results from another area as related to our work. I believe that many people in analytics are probably surprised by this result, and I would guess that they may have not known about the result previously. This phenomenon seems to be getting worse as more researchers work on similar areas, but come at the problems with different viewpoints.</p>
<p>
Can we do a better job at linking different areas of research? Finally, with respect, this seems like a result that could have been proved decades ago? Perhaps one of the great consequences of new areas like big data is to raise questions that were not thought about previously.</p>

<em> Teaching automata theory </em><br />
<font color="”#000000?"></p>
<p><a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2016/08/09/do-results-have-a-teach-by-date/unknown-110/" rel="attachment wp-att-13641"><img src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/unknown.jpeg?w=600" alt="Unknown"   class="alignright size-full wp-image-13641" /></a></p>
<p>
Noam Chomsky is famous for many many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noam_Chomsky">things</a>. He has had a lot to say over his long career, and he wrote over 100 books on topics from linguistics to war and politics. </p>
<p>Today I focus on work that he pioneered sixty years ago.</p>
<p>
Yes sixty years ago. The work is usually called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chomsky_hierarchy">Chomsky hierarchy</a>(CH) and is a hierarchy of classes of formal grammars. It was described by Noam Chomsky in 1956 driven by his interest in linguistics, not war and politics. Some add Marcel-Paul Sch&uuml;tzenberger&#8217;s name to the hierachry. He played a crucial role in the early development of the theory of formal languages&#8212;see his joint<br />
<a href="http://www-igm.univ-mlv.fr/~berstel/Mps/Travaux/A/1963-7ChomskyAlgebraic.pdf">paper</a> with Chomsky from 1962. <span id="more-13637"></span></p>
<p>
We probably all know about this hierarchy. Recall grammars define languages: </p>
<ul>
<li> Regular languages
<li> Context-free languages
<li> Context-sensistive languages
<li> And finally recursively enumerable languages
</ul>
<p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2016/08/09/do-results-have-a-teach-by-date/chom/" rel="attachment wp-att-13638"><img src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/chom.png?w=600" alt="chom"   class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13638" /></a></p>
<p>
One neat thing about this hierarchy is that it has long been known to be strict: each class is more powerful than the previous one. Each proof that the next class is more powerful is really a beautiful result. Do you know, offhand, how to <a href="https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/cs373/sp2013/Lectures/lec18.pdf">prove</a> each one?</p>
<p>
<h2> My Question </h2>
<p>
<p>I have a simple question:  </p>
<blockquote><p>
<i>Should we still teach the CH today?</i>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Before discussing let me explain some about grammars. </p>
<p>
<h2> Programming Languages </h2>
<p><p>
In the 1950&#8217;s people started to define various programming <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_compiler_construction">languages</a>. It quickly became clear that if they wanted to be precise they needed some formal method to define their languages. The formalism of context-free grammars of Noam Chomsky was well suited for at least defining the syntax of their languages&#8212;semantics were left to &#8220;English,&#8221; but at least the syntax would be well defined. </p>
<p>
Another milestone in the late 1950s was the publication, by a committee of American and European computer scientists, of &#8220;a new language for algorithms&#8221;; the ALGOL 60 Report (the &#8220;ALGOrithmic Language&#8221;). This report consolidated many ideas circulating at the time and featured several key language innovations: Perhaps one of the most useful was a mathematically exact notation, Backus-Naur Form (BNF), that was used to describe their grammar. It is not more expressive than context-free grammars, but is more user friendly and variants of still it are still used today. </p>
<p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2016/08/09/do-results-have-a-teach-by-date/bnf/" rel="attachment wp-att-13639"><img src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/bnf.png?w=300&#038;h=38" alt="bnf" width="300" height="38" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-13639" /></a></p>
<p>
I must add a story about the power of defining the syntax of a language precisely. Jeff Ullman moved from Princeton to Stanford many years ago in 1979. I must thank him, since his senior position was the one that I received in 1980. Jeff was a prolific writer of textbooks already then and used an old method from Bell Labs, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troff">TROFF</a>, to write his books. On arrival at Stanford he told me that he wanted to try out the then new system that Don Knuth had just created in 1978&#8212;of course that was the TeX system. Jeff tried the system out and liked it. But then he asked for the formal syntax description, since he wanted to be sure what the TeX language was. He asked and the answer from Knuth was: </p>
<blockquote><p>
<b>There is no formal description. None.</b>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Jeff was shocked. After all Knuth had done seminal work on context-free grammars and was well versed in formal grammars&#8212;for example Knuth invented the LR parser (Left to Right, Rightmost derivation). TeX was at the time only defined by what Knuth&#8217;s program accepted as legal. </p>
<p>
<h2> My Question Again </h2>
<p><p>
Let&#8217;s return to my question:  <i>Should we still teach the CH today?</i> </p>
<p>
It is beautiful work. I specially think the connection between context-free languages and pushdown automata is wonderful, non-obvious, and quite useful. Context free and pushdown automata led to Steve Cook&#8217;s beautiful work on two-way deterministic pushdown automata (2DPDA). He showed they could be simulated in linear time on a random-access machine.</p>
<p>
This insight was <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1309.5142.pdf">utilized</a> by Knuth to find a linear-time solution for the left-to-right pattern-matching problem, which can easily be expressed as a 2DPDA:  </p>
<blockquote><p>
<i>This was the first time in Knuth&#8217;s experience that automata theory had taught him how to solve a real programming problem better than he could solve it before.</i>
</p></blockquote>
<p>The work was finally written up and published together with Vaughan Pratt and James Morris several years later. </p>
<p>
And of course context sensitive languages led to the LBA problem. This really was the question whether nondeterministic space is closed under complement. See our discussion <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2009/02/19/we-all-guessed-wrong/">here</a>. </p>
<p>
<h2> Open Problems </h2>
<p><p>
Should I teach the old CH material? Or leave it out and teach more modern results? What do you think? Do results have a &#8220;teach-by-date?&#8221;</p>

Dan Brown is the bestselling author of the novel <i>The Da Vinci Code</i>. His most recent bestseller, published in 2013, is <i>Inferno</i>. Like two of his earlier blockbusters it has been made into a <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3062096/">movie</a>. It stars Tom Hanks and Felicity Jones and is slated for release on October 28. </p>
<p>
Today I want to talk about a curious aspect of the book <em>Inferno</em>, since it raises an interesting mathematical question.<span id="more-13629"></span></p>
<p>
Brown&#8217;s books are famous for their themes: cryptography, keys, symbols, codes, and conspiracy theories. The first four of these have a distinctive flavor of our field. Although we avoid the last in our work, it is easy to think of possible conspiracies that involve computational theory. How about these: certain groups already can factor large numbers, certain groups have real quantum computers, certain groups have trapdoors in cryptocurrencies, or &#8230;</p>
<p>
 The book has been out for awhile, but I only tried to read it the other day. It was tough to finish so I jumped to the end where the &#8220;secret&#8221; was exposed. Brown&#8217;s works have sold countless copies and yet have been attacked as being poorly written. He must be doing something very right. His prose may not be magical&#8212;whose is?&#8212;but his plots and the use of his themes usually makes for a terrific &#8220;cannot put down&#8221; book. </p>
<p>
Well I put it down. But I must be the exception. If you haven&#8217;t read the book and wish to do so without &#8220;spoilers&#8221; then you can put down this column.</p>
<p>
<p><H2> In The Inferno </H2></p>
<p><p>
<em>The Inferno</em> is about the release of a powerful virus that changes the world. Before I go into the mathematical issues this virus raises I must point out that Brown&#8217;s work has often been criticized for making scientific errors and overstepping the bounds of &#8220;plausible suspension of disbelief.&#8221; I think it is a great honor&#8212;really&#8212;that so many posts and discussions are around mistakes that he has made. Clearly there is huge interest in his books. </p>
<p>
Examples of such criticism of <em>The Inferno</em> have addressed <a href="http://blogs.plos.org/dnascience/2014/01/09/dan-browns-inferno-good-plot-bad-science/">the</a> DNA science involved, <a href="https://secretsofinferno.wordpress.com/2013/12/20/how-to-create-a-viral-vector-and-why-you-would-want-to-by-guest-blogger-kristen-elise-ph-d/">the</a> kind of virus used, <a href="http://genomealberta.ca/blogs/the-real-science-of-dan-browns-inferno.aspx">the</a> hows of genetic engineering and virus detection, and <a href="http://www.populationelephant.com/DanBrownessay.html">the</a> population projections, some of which we get into below. There is also an entire <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Secrets-Inferno-Footsteps-Dante-Brown/dp/1611880823">book</a> about Brown&#8217;s novel, <em>Secrets of Inferno</em></p>
<p>
However, none of these seems to address a simple point that we hadn&#8217;t found anywhere, until Ken noticed it raised <a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/documents/reading_list/indices/book_912.html">here</a> on the often-helpful <i>FourmiLab</i> <a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch">site</a> maintained by the popular science writer John Walker. It appears when you click &#8220;Show Spoilers&#8221; on that page, so again you may stop reading if you don&#8217;t wish to know.</p>
<p>
<p><H2> How The Virus Works&#8212;or Doesn&#8217;t? </H2></p>
<p><p>
How does the virus work? The goal of the virus is to stop population explosion. </p>
<p>
The book hints that it is airborne, so we may assume that everyone in the world is infected by it&#8212;all women in particular. Brown says that 1/3 are made infertile. There are two ways to think about this statement. It depends on the exact definition of the mechanism causing infertility.</p>
<p>
The first way is that when you get infected by the virus a coin is flipped and with probability 1/3 you are unable to have children. That is, when the virus attacks your original DNA there is a 1/3 chance the altered genes render you infertile. In the 2/3-case that the virus embeds in a way that does not cause infertility, that gets passed on to children and there is no further effect. In the 1/3-case that the alteration causes infertility, that property too gets passed on. Except, that is, for the issue in this famous <a href="https://www.quotespick.com/10771/having-children-is-hereditary-if.php">quote</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Having Children Is Hereditary: If Your Parents Didn&#8217;t Have Any, Then You Probably Won&#8217;t Either.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Thus the effect &#8220;dies out&#8221; almost immediately; it would necessarily be just one-shot on the current generation. </p>
<p><p>
The second way is that the virus allows the initial receiver to be fertile but has its effect when (female) children are born. In one third of cases the woman becomes infertile, and otherwise is able to have children when she grows up. </p>
<p>
In this case the effect seems to work as claimed in the book. Children all get the virus and it keeps flipping coins forever. Walker still isn&#8217;t sure&#8212;we won&#8217;t reveal here the words he hides but you can find them. In any event, the point remains that this would become a much more complex virus. And Brown does not explain this point in his book&#8212;at least I am unsure if he even sees the necessary distinctions. </p>
<p>
The other discussions focus on issues like how society would react to this reduction in fertility. Except for part of one we noted above, however, none seems to address the novel&#8217;s mathematical presumptions. </p>
<p>
<p><H2> The Math and Aftermath </H2></p>
<p><p>
The purpose of the virus is to reduce the growth rate in the world&#8217;s population. By how much is not clear in the book. The over-arching issue is that it is hard to find conditions under which the <em>projection</em> of the effect is stable. </p>
<p>
For example, suppose we can divide time into discrete units of generations so that the world population <em>of women</em> after <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{t}" title="{t}" class="latex" /> generations follows the exponential growth curve <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN+%3D+N_0+r%5Et%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{N = N_0 r^t}" title="{N = N_0 r^t}" class="latex" />. Ignoring the natural rate of infertility and male-female imbalance and other factors for simplicity, this envisions <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{N}" title="{N}" class="latex" /> women having <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{r}" title="{r}" class="latex" /> <em>female</em> children on average. The intent seems to be to replace this with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2N%2F3%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{2N/3}" title="{2N/3}" class="latex" /> women having <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{r}" title="{r}" class="latex" /> female children each, for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%27+%3D+2rN%2F3%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{N&#039; = 2rN/3}" title="{N&#039; = 2rN/3}" class="latex" /> in the next generation. This means multiplying <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{N}" title="{N}" class="latex" /> by <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cfrac%7B2%7D%7B3%7Dr%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{&#92;frac{2}{3}r}" title="{&#92;frac{2}{3}r}" class="latex" />, so </p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++N%27_t+%3D+N_0+%5Cleft%28%5Cfrac%7B2%7D%7B3%7Dr%5Cright%29%5Et+&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="&#92;displaystyle  N&#039;_t = N_0 &#92;left(&#92;frac{2}{3}r&#92;right)^t " title="&#92;displaystyle  N&#039;_t = N_0 &#92;left(&#92;frac{2}{3}r&#92;right)^t " class="latex" /></p>
<p>
becomes the new curve. The problem is that this tends to <em>zero</em> unless <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br+%5Cgeq+3%2F2%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{r &#92;geq 3/2}" title="{r &#92;geq 3/2}" class="latex" />, whereas the estimates of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0" alt="{r}" title="{r}" class="latex" /> that you can get from tables such as <a href="http://www.worldometers.info/world-population/#growthrate">this</a> are uniformly lower at least since 2000. </p>
<p>
The point is that the blunt &#8220;1/3&#8221; factor of the virus is thinking only in such simplistic terms about &#8220;exponential growth&#8221;&#8212;yet in the same terms there is no region of stability. Either growth remains exponential or humanity crashes. Maybe the latter possibility is implicit in the dark allusions to Dante Alighieri&#8217;s <em>Inferno</em> that permeate the plot. </p>
<p>
In reality, as our <a href="http://www.populationelephant.com/DanBrownessay.html">source</a> points out, it would not take much for humanity to compensate. If a generation is 30 years and we are missing 33&#037; of women, then what&#8217;s needed is for just over 3&#037; of the remaining women to change their minds about not having a child in any given year. We don&#8217;t want to trivialize the effect of infertility, but there is much more to adaptability than the book&#8217;s tenet presumes.</p>
