&amp;nbsp;Is there any such thing? &amp;nbsp;If there is, doesn&#39;t it sound like something North Korea would come up with? &amp;nbsp;Our higher form of &lt;i&gt;democracy&lt;/i&gt; has transcended mere &amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;politics&lt;/i&gt;. &amp;nbsp;Uh huh. &amp;nbsp;Sure. &amp;nbsp;I know where you&#39;re going with &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As objective realities&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: white; color: #252525; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.4px;&quot;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;structures of governance&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: white; color: #252525; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.4px;&quot;&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;aren&#39;t &lt;i&gt;democracy&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;politics&lt;/i&gt; in fact... synonyms?

Unfortunately, it is really useless to maintain open public comments after the slightest attention in mass-market media.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend other writers to read, but it seems presumptuous, patronizing and rude.&amp;nbsp; Whom should you read?&amp;nbsp; Alas, I fear you&#39;ve already made that decision.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ll follow Alexander, and simply say: read the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I do want to give a special shout out to &lt;a href=&quot;http://withendemanndom.blogspot.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Deogolwulf&lt;/a&gt;, for his &lt;a href=&quot;http://withendemanndom.blogspot.com/2014/07/slavoj-zizek-philosophaster-and_9.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;literary scalping&lt;/a&gt; of Slavoj Žižek.  Not that a zombie really needs his scalp, but at least you get to keep it.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Better yet, give the living a rest and read the dead.&amp;nbsp; For instance, it&#39;s the broad general consensus of modern professional historians that James Buchanan was USG&#39;s &lt;i&gt;worst President evah&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Well... haters gonna hate.&amp;nbsp; But why not give our own dear reality the benefit of the doubt, set that consensus as a prior - and then read &lt;i&gt;Mr. Buchanan&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.org/details/mrbuchanansadmin1866buch&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;own book&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/i&gt; Which he actually, believe it or not, &lt;i&gt;wrote himself&lt;/i&gt;?&amp;nbsp; Like, you know, a &lt;i&gt;real person&lt;/i&gt;?&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know.&amp;nbsp; I know.&amp;nbsp; You, also a real person, are too busy to read James Buchanan.&amp;nbsp; But not too busy to hate him.&amp;nbsp; Well, haters, etc.&amp;nbsp; And for non-haters, if your dear little prior needs any more of a workout, which frankly would surprise me, work it again with &lt;a href=&quot;http://foseti.wordpress.com/2013/04/27/review-of-lincoln-the-man-by-edgar-lee-masters/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Lincoln The Man&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Personally I feel Lincoln is really the first of the modern Presidents, because I have a strong suspicion that just about every brilliant utterance we attribute to Lincoln, is actually the work of his brilliant young secretaries Nicolay and Hay.&amp;nbsp; Another unprovable conspiracy theory, I know, I know. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By curious coincidence, our leaders today, while of course great statesmen of historic proportions, are major writers in their copious spare time.&amp;nbsp; Really any of their masterpieces - I saw a whole box at Costco the other day - will do for a chaser.&amp;nbsp; But why not - &lt;i&gt;Dreams From My Father&lt;/i&gt;?&amp;nbsp; If you do complete this grueling assignment, yet still find yourself taking the &quot;real world&quot; seriously, please write to UR for our warranty coverage.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway.&amp;nbsp; UR will reemerge, of course.&amp;nbsp; But not here, and not soon - and probably not even in this form.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ll also try to do something non-lame with the archives.&amp;nbsp; Thanks for reading!</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7958140996781104565/posts/default/1995319782811751909'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7958140996781104565/posts/default/1995319782811751909'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2014/08/hiatus.html' title='Hiatus'/><author><name>Mencius Moldbug</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/16472157249344139282</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7958140996781104565.post-1108805939805439473</id><published>2014-08-01T20:10:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2014-08-01T20:17:41.388-07:00</updated><title type='text'>The Anarchy</title><content type='html'>The center cannot hold!&amp;nbsp;

Death the crocodile,&lt;br /&gt;&quot;A master from Germany&quot; but not just Germany.&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Or traffic in the grasshoppers or bees.&quot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;A war of three crocodiles.&amp;nbsp;

target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Something is happening here&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; But you don&#39;t know what it is - do you, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballad_of_a_Thin_Man#Interpretation&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mr. Jones&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is there anyone else in the room who&#39;s here because he&#39;s just plain embarrassed by the present world?&amp;nbsp; The past is a foreign country, someone once said.&amp;nbsp; If the past is a foreign country, someone else said, a reactionary is a patriot of that country.&amp;nbsp; Almost an exile from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And unlike the presentist, who sees the past as a tiny, backward and contemptible province of his vast eternal present, the reactionary knows the opposite.&amp;nbsp; The present is a province of the past.&amp;nbsp; Yes, it&#39;s true - like any province, it has its specialties.&amp;nbsp; The food, for instance.&amp;nbsp; The iPads - superb.&amp;nbsp; The movies - never better. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But overall!&amp;nbsp; Stuck here like Ovid among the Pontic Greeks, Augustus beyond deaf to all appeal, the civilized man can only murmur: &lt;i&gt;barbarus hic ego sum&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Does he wish for friends?&amp;nbsp; He has no shortage - he could not imagine better.&amp;nbsp; No, what he really needs is a better grade of &lt;i&gt;critics&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; The bar is too low.&amp;nbsp; And when you&#39;re trying - absurdly of course, but with real feeling - to write &lt;i&gt;sub specie aeternitas&lt;/i&gt;, that&#39;s what kills ya.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Rome, of course, critics were no problem.&amp;nbsp; Out here in Pontus, it&#39;s pretty much all, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRQijskAMp4&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;you talk like a fag&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; What makes the provincial critic so grimly, hilariously terrible is that he imagines himself not just equal to the wits of the metropolis, but vastly superior.&amp;nbsp; Is it even possible to respond?&amp;nbsp; Shall the man of letters respond: &quot;excuse me, &#39;Dr. Lexus,&#39; but I am resolutely heterosexual - as if it mattered - and &#39;my shit,&#39; as you call it, is anything but &#39;all retarded&#39;?&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the present world, province though it be, has some advantages.&amp;nbsp; It does exist and we do have to live here. So, from one barbarian to another, perhaps a brief comment is in order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not to the original source.&amp;nbsp; Argue with Dr. Lexus?&amp;nbsp; Really?&amp;nbsp; With Mr. Jones?&amp;nbsp; When Mr. Jones is not quite sure whether he&#39;s a belletrist or a &lt;a href=&quot;http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2013/09/technology-communism-and-brown-scare.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Stasi-Mann&lt;/a&gt; (apparently &quot;Doxing 101&quot; is the cornerstone of the media and communications major these days at Pontus State); when neither he nor his undoubtedly overworked copy editor can balance a quote, place a comma, or master the mysterious art of the proper noun - &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v_BVNGAfYM&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;forget it, Ovid&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s Pontus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, obviously no one should ever respond to a journalist.&amp;nbsp; (Or a Stasi-Mann.)&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s a mistake to think these people have opinions.&amp;nbsp; They have careers.&amp;nbsp; They&#39;re paid by the click and not paid well.&amp;nbsp; If you or I had Mr. Jones&#39; job,&amp;nbsp; we&#39;d write what he writes or lose it - maybe in slightly better English.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s a mistake to anthropomorphize Mr. Jones.&amp;nbsp; He&#39;s a piece in a machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The basic nature of constitutional government is the formalization of power, and democracy is the formalization of mob violence.&amp;nbsp; Why is America&#39;s constitution democratic?&amp;nbsp; Because the Puritan mob drove Charles I (who, like Louis XVI and Nicholas II, was basically just a nice guy) out of London in 1642.&amp;nbsp; In a present world where mob violence is a thing of the past, we wouldn&#39;t expect to see genuine demotic opinion actually matter in the political process - much as we wouldn&#39;t expect to see feudal knights matter in a world that&#39;s invented the musket.&amp;nbsp; For instance, the closest thing America has to a non-astroturf political force is the Tea Party.&amp;nbsp; Which doesn&#39;t even litter.&amp;nbsp; Nor does it matter, and this is not a coincidence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#39;t think it&#39;s an exaggeration to call journalism the last real remnant of American democracy.&amp;nbsp; The job is about two things: minting clicks for slave wages, and feeling important.&amp;nbsp; (You might say that journalists are paid both in money and in power.)&amp;nbsp; Anything that can produce a good Two Minutes&#39; Hate punches both buttons.&amp;nbsp; If one Mr. Jones misses it, the next won&#39;t.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ve seen the future of journalism in America.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s called &lt;a href=&quot;http://upworthy.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Upworthy&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s exactly what Pontus both demands and deserves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately, the Pontic mob has both the attention and the testicles of a gnat, and its bite-to-bark ratio is really difficult to understate.&amp;nbsp; Since I regret everything pathetic in the present world, and especially the death of all kings, I mourn even &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Riots&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;King Mob&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; (After all, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priestley_Riots&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Priestley&lt;/a&gt; got exactly what he deserved.)&amp;nbsp; In this case, though...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway.&amp;nbsp; So much for Mr. Jones.&amp;nbsp; But Pontus does offer its rewards, even intellectually.&amp;nbsp; When I think of the Pontic critics, my mind turns always to &lt;a href=&quot;http://books.google.com/books?id=7bU4AAAAMAAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA203&amp;amp;dq=buck+harkness&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ei=4Y-XUr9Zh_yLAunLgdAH&amp;amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=buck%20harkness&amp;amp;f=false&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Buck Harkness&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; The tragedy of Buck Harkness, &quot;half a man,&quot; is that he was born with all the ingredients to be a Colonel Sherburn.&amp;nbsp; But nurture played him false - the bar was too low.&amp;nbsp; In Pontus, half a man is all the best of men can be.&amp;nbsp; (In Rome, I&#39;d be instantly exposed as a ridiculous poser for talking about Ovid when I never even learned Latin.&amp;nbsp; Whereas in Pontus, just the fact that I&#39;ve &lt;i&gt;heard&lt;/i&gt; of Ovid makes me sound like a fag.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take &lt;a href=&quot;http://davidbrin.blogspot.com/2013/11/neo-reactionaries-drop-all-pretense-end.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;David Brin&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Insomuch as Pontus has real writers - real critics, even - Brin is one.&amp;nbsp; When I was twelve I read one of his books and really enjoyed it.&amp;nbsp; Something about superintelligent mutant dolphins in an alien ocean.&amp;nbsp; He has ideas, too - I&#39;ve been meaning to read &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Transparent_Society&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; for a while.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s not terribly controversial to me, and, you know, 20th-century ideas.&amp;nbsp; When there&#39;s so much of Maistre I haven&#39;t gotten to yet.&amp;nbsp; But it offended a lot of the usual Pontic pundits, and who can argue with that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But really.&amp;nbsp; Your Pontic Buck Harkness shows no signs of ever having read anything pre-1922, except inasmuch as he was maybe assigned an excerpt from it in college.&amp;nbsp; Colonel Sherburn shouldn&#39;t have to argue with Buck Harkness and his mob.&amp;nbsp; If he&#39;s really Colonel Sherburn, he just sends them home.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s less a fight than an episode of Knockout Game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So for instance, Brin seems very big on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Enlightenment&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; It would be interesting to know the last book from the Enlightenment he read.&amp;nbsp; If he&#39;s read any.&amp;nbsp; My suspicion is that what he reveres is not actually the &lt;i&gt;actual&lt;/i&gt; Enlightenment, but the &quot;Enlightenment&quot; as taught in 20th-century universities.&amp;nbsp; Did you know that powdered eggs are actually made from actual eggs?&amp;nbsp; Imagine a science-fiction dystopia in which, perhaps on board your starship, you ate powdered eggs for breakfast every day.&amp;nbsp; Eggs, to you, are powdered eggs.&amp;nbsp; Real eggs are illegal.&amp;nbsp; Or something.&amp;nbsp; But one day, someone smuggles an actual chicken on board...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I think of the Enlightenment, for instance, the man who jumps to mind is &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hume&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Hume&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Pontus is a busy place and perhaps you don&#39;t have time to appreciate Hume yourself.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ve read a good bit of his &lt;a href=&quot;http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=1868&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;History of England&lt;/a&gt;, which is excellent and really ought to be updated in the proper spirit.&amp;nbsp; But I&#39;ll just quote Wikipedia, which of course contains the truth on all subjects:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;David Hume was a Scottish philosopher, historian, economist, and essayist known especially for his philosophical empiricism and skepticism. He was one of the most important figures in the history of Western philosophy and the Scottish Enlightenment.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Unfortunately for Buck Harkness, Hume&#39;s ideal form of government was... a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.davidhume.org/texts/emp.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&quot;civilized monarchy&quot;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;In a civilized monarchy, the prince alone is unrestrained in the exercise of his authority, and possesses alone a power, which is not bounded by any thing but custom, example, and the sense of his own interest. Every minister or magistrate, however eminent, must submit to the general laws, which govern the whole society, and must exert the authority delegated to him after the manner, which is prescribed. The people depend on none but their sovereign, for the security of their property. He is so far removed from them, and is so much exempt from private jealousies or interests, that this dependence is scarcely felt. And thus a species of government arises, to which, in a high political rant, we may give the name of &lt;i&gt;Tyranny&lt;/i&gt;, but which, by a just and prudent administration, may afford tolerable security to the people, and may answer most of the ends of political society.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;But though in a civilized monarchy, as well as in a republic, the people have security for the enjoyment of their property; yet in both these forms of government, those who possess the supreme authority have the disposal of many honours and advantages, which excite the ambition and avarice of mankind. The only difference is, that, in a republic, the candidates for office must look downwards, to gain the suffrages of the people; in a monarchy, they must turn their attention upwards, to court the good graces and favour of the great. To be successful in the former way, it is necessary for a man to make himself &lt;i&gt;useful&lt;/i&gt;, by his industry, capacity, or knowledge: To be prosperous in the latter way, it is requisite for him to render himself &lt;i&gt;agreeable&lt;/i&gt;, by his wit, complaisance, or civility. A strong genius succeeds best in republics; a refined taste in monarchies. And consequently the sciences are the more natural growth of the one, and the polite arts of the other.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Moreover, when we read the Enlightenment, we pay it very little respect indeed if we read it as if it was the Bible.&amp;nbsp; Hume today would both read and &lt;i&gt;judge&lt;/i&gt; himself, and so must we.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For instance, Hume genuinely believed that the way to gain &quot;the suffrages of the people&quot; was for a politician to &quot;make himself useful, by his industry, capacity, or knowledge.&quot;&amp;nbsp; Was he... a moron?&amp;nbsp; Did he... talk like a fag?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, his work is a product of its time and place - the Whig aristocracy of 18th-century Britain, a marvelous synthesis of the old Puritan and feudal strains which somehow preserved the virtues of both.&amp;nbsp; It really was (to some extent) true that the Puritan middle classes of his era were a remarkably virtuous people.&amp;nbsp; Empowering them with republican forms created a regime that wasn&#39;t called Augustan for nothing, and laid the foundations for the empire in whose ruins we live.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But even by the late 18th century, this structure, really a settlement of the great 17th-century conflict, is crumbling.&amp;nbsp; The engineering does not work.&amp;nbsp; The republic is too strong for the monarchy and begins to tear it down.&amp;nbsp; And the virtue... oh, now I&#39;m making myself cry.&amp;nbsp; Where did all that Puritan virtue come from, anyway?&amp;nbsp; It brought down the Stuarts.&amp;nbsp; But it was not born under the Stuarts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hume would be the first to point out that the constitution of any country depends on the actual people of that country.&amp;nbsp; Republican forms are not an end in and of themselves.&amp;nbsp; When virtue is widely distributed, these forms are a way of concentrating and employing it.&amp;nbsp; You will find writers who believe republican forms can build a virtuous state from a vile electorate.&amp;nbsp; Hume is not among them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, I suspect the average Pontic will accuse me of a little bait and switch here.&amp;nbsp; When he thinks of the &quot;Enlightenment,&quot; he doesn&#39;t think of the Scottish Enlightenment.&amp;nbsp; He thinks of the French Enlightenment.&amp;nbsp; He goes &quot;full Rousseau.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To explain what a sane 21st-century reader should think of the French Enlightenment - once again, not worshipping it in medieval scholastic fashion, but &lt;i&gt;judging&lt;/i&gt; it in Enlightenment fashion - I have no better quote than the great dialogue of Taine, from the close of his &lt;a href=&quot;http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=2426&amp;amp;Itemid=27&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Origins of Contemporary France&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Who?&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippolyte_Taine&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Hippolyte Taine&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Yeah, I know.&amp;nbsp; He sounds like a fag.&amp;nbsp; Worse, he&#39;s quoting (probably with some editing) another obvious fag, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Fran%C3%A7ois_de_La_Harpe&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;La Harpe&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;It seems to me, [La Harpe] says, as if it were but yesterday, and yet it is at the beginning of the year 1788. We were dining with one of our fellow members of the Academy, a grand seignior and a man of intelligence. The company was numerous and of every profession, courtiers, advocates, men of letters and academicians, all had feasted luxuriously according to custom. At the dessert the wines of Malvoisie and of Constance contributed to the social gaiety a sort of freedom not always kept within decorous limits. At that time society had reached the point at which everything may be expressed that excites laughter. Champfort had read to us his impious and libertine stories, and great ladies had listened to these without recourse to their fans. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;Hence a deluge of witticisms against religion, one quoting a tirade from &#39;La Pucelle,&#39; another bringing forward certain philosophical stanzas by Diderot. . . . and with unbounded applause. . . . The conversation becomes more serious; admiration is expressed at the revolution accomplished by Voltaire, and all agree in its being the first title to his fame. &#39;He gave the tone to his century, finding readers in the antechambers as well as in the drawing-room.&#39; One of the guests narrates, bursting with laughter, what a hairdresser said to him while powdering his hair: &#39;You see, sir, although I am a miserable scrub, I have no more religion than any one else.&#39;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;They conclude that the Revolution will soon be consummated, that superstition and fanaticism must wholly give way to philosophy, and they thus calculate the probabilities of the epoch and those of the future society which will see the reign of reason. The most aged lament not being able to flatter themselves that they will see it; the young rejoice in a reasonable prospect of seeing it, and especially do they congratulate the Academy on having paved the way for the great work, and on having been the headquarters, the center, the inspirer of freedom of thought.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;One of the guests had taken no part in this gay conversation; a person named Cazotte, an amiable and original man, but, unfortunately, infatuated with the delusions of the visionary. In the most serious tone he begins: &#39;Gentlemen,&#39; says he, &#39;be content; you will witness this great revolution that you so much desire. You know that I am something of a prophet, and I repeat it, you will witness it. . . . Do you know the result of this revolution, for all of you, so long as you remain here?&#39;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&#39;Ah!&#39; exclaims Condorcet with his shrewd, simple air and smile, &#39;let us see, a philosopher is not sorry to encounter a prophet.&#39;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&#39;You, Monsieur de Condorcet, will expire stretched on the floor of a dungeon; you will die of the poison you take to escape the executioner, of the poison which the felicity of that era will compel you always to carry about your person!&#39;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;At first, great astonishment, and then came an outburst of laughter. &#39;What has all this in common with philosophy and the reign of reason?&#39;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&#39;Precisely what I have just remarked to you; in the name of philosophy, of humanity, of freedom, under the reign of reason, you will thus reach your end; and, evidently, the reign of reason will arrive, for there will be temples of reason, and, in those days, in all France, the temples will be those alone of reason. . . . You, Monsieur de Champfort, you will sever your veins with twenty-two strokes of a razor and yet you will not die for months afterwards. You, Monsieur Vicq-d&#39;Azir, you will not open your own veins but you will have them opened six times in one day, in the agonies of gout, so as to be more certain of success, and you will die that night. You, Monsieur de Nicolai, on the scaffold; you, Monsieur Bailly, on the scaffold; you, Monsieur de Malesherbes, on the scaffold;. . . you, Monsieur Roucher, also on the scaffold.&#39;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&#39;But then we shall have been overcome by Turks or Tartars?&#39;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&#39;By no means; you will be governed, as I have already told you, solely by philosophy and reason. Those who are to treat you in this manner will all be philosophers, will all, at every moment, have on their lips the phrases you have uttered within the hour, will repeat your maxims, will quote, like yourselves, the stanzas of Diderot and of &quot;La Pucelle.&quot;&#39;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&#39;And when will all this happen?&#39;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&#39;Six years will not pass before what I tell you will be accomplished.&#39;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&#39;Well, these are miracles,&#39; exclaims La Harpe, &#39;and you leave me out?&#39;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&#39;You will be no less a miracle, for you will then be a Christian.&#39;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&#39;Ah,&#39; interposes Champfort, I breathe again; if we are to die only when La Harpe becomes a Christian we are immortals.&#39;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&#39;As to that, we women,&#39; says the Duchesse de Gramont, &#39;are extremely fortunate in being of no consequence in revolutions. It is understood that we are not to blame, and our sex.&#39;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&#39;Your sex, ladies, will not protect you this time. . . . You will be treated precisely as men, with no difference whatever. . . . You, Madame la Duchesse, will be led to the scaffold, you and many ladies besides yourself in a cart with your hands tied behind your back.&#39;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&#39;Ah, in that event, I hope to have at least a carriage covered with black.&#39;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&#39;No, Madame, greater ladies than yourself will go, like yourself in a cart and with their hands tied like yours.&#39;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&#39;Greater ladies! What! Princesses of the blood!&#39;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&#39;Still greater ladies than those. . .&#39;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;They began to think the jest carried too far. Madame de Gramont, to dispel the gloom, did not insist on a reply to her last exclamation, contenting herself by saying in the lightest tone, &#39;And they will not even leave one a confessor!&#39;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&#39;No, Madame, neither you nor any other person will be allowed a confessor; the last of the condemned that will have one, as an act of grace, will be. . .&#39; He stopped a moment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&#39;Tell me, now, who is the fortunate mortal enjoying this prerogative?&#39; &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&#39;It is the last that will remain to him, and it will be the King of France.&#39;&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Imagine the fate of poor &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marquis_de_Condorcet&quot;&gt;Condorcet&lt;/a&gt;. He has drunk his own medicine. Condorcet, the scientist! Lucky the scientist whose hypothesis is never tested.&amp;nbsp; Condorcet&#39;s was tested.&amp;nbsp; Unlucky Condorcet - unlucky France.&amp;nbsp; Who can see France today and not realize that it has never recovered from the Revolution?&amp;nbsp; Go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-Denis&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Saint-Denis&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; See the looted tombs of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Maurras&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&quot;thirty kings who made France.&quot;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; Then get back to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_de_France_%E2%80%93_Saint-Denis_(Paris_RER)&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;RER&lt;/a&gt; as fast as you can - you&#39;re in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitive_urban_zone&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ZUS&lt;/a&gt;...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But most agonizing of all for this scientist, &lt;i&gt;he&lt;/i&gt; (like La Harpe) has thought scientifically.&amp;nbsp; He has seen his hypothesis tested, and (presumably) stopped believing in it.&amp;nbsp; &lt;i&gt;You&lt;/i&gt; have not. Or, well... Buck Harkness has not.&amp;nbsp; He did study science at one point, didn&#39;t he?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Imagine that revolution is a drug.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s seeking FDA approval.&amp;nbsp; This drug, it&#39;s claimed, creates social harmony, good government, the &quot;reign of reason.&quot;&amp;nbsp; The mechanism has been studied.&amp;nbsp; Philosophers everywhere agree.&amp;nbsp; The chemistry seems plausible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At what point in history do you approve the drug?&amp;nbsp; After the French Revolution?&amp;nbsp; The Russian?&amp;nbsp; Where, in history, do we see the drug produce its claimed results?&amp;nbsp; Everywhere - from France in 1789, to Russia in 1917, Libya and Syria in 2012 - we see social catastrophe, mass murder, and the most rigid and savage of military despotisms.&amp;nbsp; Historical comparisons are difficult, of course, but when we&#39;re talking about a &lt;i&gt;therapy&lt;/i&gt;, the first comparison is obvious: the patient before, the patient after.&amp;nbsp; I mean, duh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yet, the good doctors of philosophy, not giving a shit about Hippocrates (obviously a fag) continue prescribing this medicine.&amp;nbsp; The Enlightenment cannot heal itself.&amp;nbsp; It cannot judge itself.&amp;nbsp; Having given birth to the monster of Jacobinism, it produces this same monster again and again - in the 20th century and even the 21st.&amp;nbsp; It finds a perfectly functional, if hardly perfect, absolute monarchy, and replaces it with chaos and terror and death - the rule of the gun at its most direct and barbaric, the &quot;Turks and Tartars.&quot;&amp;nbsp; Then it pats itself on the back.&amp;nbsp; Freedom! Yeah, man, freedom!&amp;nbsp; You talk like a fag who doesn&#39;t believe in freedom, man.&amp;nbsp; Freedom is cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But David (no relation to Sergey) Brin lands what he&#39;s sure is a deadly knockout punch:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;North and South Korea.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Oh, dear!&amp;nbsp; Tell me, Mr. Harkness: what is the difference between Kim Jong-un, Elizabeth I, and Louis XIV?&amp;nbsp; Let&#39;s see: all three are absolute monarchs.&amp;nbsp; One of them is an insane dictator who throws whole families in concentration camps.&amp;nbsp; The other two... talked like fags?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The enormous chutzpah by which a loyal disciple of the Age of Revolution attributes the North Korean monster to a reactionary absence of revolution can&#39;t be overstated.&amp;nbsp; Who is Kim Il-sung?&amp;nbsp; Is he more like Louis XVI, or more like Robespierre?&amp;nbsp; North Korea is not the converse of revolution.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s the &lt;i&gt;product&lt;/i&gt; of revolution - exported overland from America, through Moscow out of John Reed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, Korea was a perfectly successful and flourishing nation before we spread our cancer there.&amp;nbsp; To the extent that anything of Korean culture remains after the devastation of the 20th century, it is the culture of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseon_Dynasty&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Chosen Dynasty&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; This empire was utterly determined to preserve Korea as Korea, adopting a policy of isolation very similar to that of the Tokugawa in Japan and the Qing in China.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alas, all three failed, or we&#39;d have a Japan, China and Korea that actually was Japanese, Chinese or Korean in some sense, you know, other than the language, the script and the gene pool.&amp;nbsp; What a treat that would be!&amp;nbsp; To have an actual non-American civilization, alive and well and living in the 21st century!&amp;nbsp; Give me a passenger pigeon while you&#39;re at it.&amp;nbsp; Indeed, the mentality of Commodore Perry is very like the mentality that clubbed the passenger pigeon to death with sticks, and ate it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead, after a century drenched in blood, largely through bizarre Cold War PR games that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Odd-Man-Out-Truman-Origins/dp/1574883437&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;no one really understands yet&lt;/a&gt;, we end up with an American puppet state in the South and a Communist prison state in the North.&amp;nbsp; Certainly the American puppet state is preferable to the Communist prison state.&amp;nbsp; The whole Anglo-American tradition, which created this monster of revolution and unleashed it on the world, is also the most immune to it - on some days, you could even believe you were living in Hume&#39;s &quot;civilized monarchy.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What shines through every line of Brin&#39;s screed is this revolutionary passion for murder, desolation, destruction.&amp;nbsp; The Voltaires and the Condorcets, in France&#39;s civilized monarchy, could play with this same fire like a toy.&amp;nbsp; At present the power of the fire seems pretty weak (which is why I can write this stuff, without a mob burning down my house) - it really is a toy.&amp;nbsp; A tacky toy.&amp;nbsp; On the other hand, we still export this toy, and it just burned down pretty much the entire Middle East (except Egypt, which somehow has by the skin of its teeth escaped - infuriating the NYT &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/26/world/middleeast/egypt-law-street-protests.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;no end&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And there&#39;s something else, besides its revolutionary heritage, that few of us notice about North Korea: it&#39;s at war against the entire civilized world.&amp;nbsp; At least, the entire civilized world would love to replace its regime, which is pretty much the definition of &quot;at war.&quot;&amp;nbsp; If Washington doesn&#39;t bother with the Korean equivalent of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=%22qaddafi%20must%20go%22&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&quot;Qaddafi must go&quot;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=%22assad%20must%20go%22&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&quot;Assad must go&quot;&lt;/a&gt;, it&#39;s only because it doesn&#39;t believe it can get itself obeyed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a world that was willing to tolerate the Chosen Dynasty, the Chosen Dynasty would still exist.&amp;nbsp; It died because it couldn&#39;t secure itself against a hostile world.&amp;nbsp; Burke in his &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.econlib.org/library/LFBooks/Burke/brkSWv3c1.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Letters on a Regicide Peace&lt;/a&gt; describes the foreign policy of the Jacobins, since inherited by America:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;In other words, their will is the law, not only at home,  but as to the concerns of every nation. Who has made that law but the  Regicide Republick itself, whose laws, like those of the Medes and  Persians, they cannot alter or abrogate, or even so much as take into  consideration? Without the least ceremony or compliment, they have sent  out of the world whole sets of laws and lawgivers. They have swept away  the very constitutions under which the Legislatures acted, and the Laws  were made. Even the fundamental &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blogger.com/null&quot; name=&quot;burke3.1.p90l34&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;anchor_e79&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;sacred Rights of Man  they have not scrupled to profane. They have set this holy code at  naught with ignominy and scorn. Thus they treat all their domestic laws  and constitutions, and even what they had considered as a Law of Nature;  but whatever they have put their seal on for the purposes of their  ambition, and the ruin of their neighbours, this alone is invulnerable, impassible, immortal. Assuming to be  masters of every thing human and divine, here, and here alone, it seems  they are limited, &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blogger.com/null&quot; name=&quot;burke3.1.p91l7&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;footnote&quot; id=&quot;anchor_e80&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;cooped  and cabined in&quot;; and this omnipotent legislature finds itself wholly  without the power of exercising its favourite attribute, the love of  peace. In other words, they are powerful to usurp, impotent to restore;  and equally by their power and their impotence they aggrandize  themselves, and weaken and impoverish you and all other nations.  &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;It&#39;s small wonder that a regime that dares to fight against the universal revolution, and actually has preserved itself, would be a bit Spartan and more than a bit insane.&amp;nbsp; Revolution created North Korea, but the North Korean state has an obvious desire to evolve into something much more like the Chosen Dynasty - the general process of recovering from revolution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a world in which Americans actually &lt;i&gt;cared&lt;/i&gt; about North Koreans, rather than just using them as&amp;nbsp;rhetorical pawns, or salivating about their chances of causing yet another revolution or civil war, Americans would see that the easiest way to let North Korea heal is to acknowledge the Kim dynasty as what it is: a monarchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If rather than exporting revolution 24/7, US foreign policy was actually capable of respecting, supporting and securing its sovereign peers the way, you know, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lonang.com/exlibris/vattel/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;classical international law of the Enlightenment era&lt;/a&gt; suggests, the Kims would have &lt;i&gt;no need&lt;/i&gt; for their concentration camps.&amp;nbsp; Possibly they&#39;re so insane that they&#39;d keep them anyway - but I suspect not.&amp;nbsp; Historical examples of a genuinely insane monarch are rare - he has trouble hanging on to his throne.&amp;nbsp; The regime in North Korea has a very simple problem, which is that if it relaxes its grip it explodes.&amp;nbsp; The only actions that the outside world can take which will solve this problem: remove the regime by force, or accept and support it.&amp;nbsp; I don&#39;t see anyone proposing either, which leaves me to think Americans don&#39;t actually care very much about the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Aquariums_of_Pyongyang&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;aquariums of Pyongyang.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when he considers the faith in revolution as a whole, the sane man must consider it as a kind of satanic church of murder.&amp;nbsp; It is as irrational as it is dangerous.&amp;nbsp; Or to use a simpler word: &lt;i&gt;insane&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; There is a kind of symmetry here: to Pontus I appear an insane barbarian; it seems natural to me, therefore, to view Pontus as a country of insane barbarians.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Insanity has consequences - big and small.&amp;nbsp; The &quot;Arab Spring&quot; is big, but at least it&#39;s far away.&amp;nbsp; I want to talk a little more about the local consequences and knock out another critic or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;David Brin didn&#39;t come up with his Korean &quot;evidence&quot; by himself.&amp;nbsp; He got it from a fellow named Scott Alexander, who&#39;s produced a gargantuan and humorless &lt;a href=&quot;http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/10/20/the-anti-reactionary-faq/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&quot;Anti-Reactionary FAQ.&quot;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Again, the constant embarrassment of life in Pontus is that you wish for better critics than you have.&amp;nbsp; I really ought to give this thing the thorough reaming it deserves.&amp;nbsp; But in general, it&#39;s not bad enough to be funny and not good enough to be interesting.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m a busy guy and my motivation does flag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alexander is a disciple of the equally humorless &quot;rationalist&quot; movement &lt;a href=&quot;http://lesswrong.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Less Wrong&lt;/a&gt;, a sort of Internet update of Robespierre&#39;s good old &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult_of_Reason&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Cult of Reason&lt;/a&gt;, Lenin&#39;s very rational &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Isaac%27s_Cathedral&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Museums of Atheism&lt;/a&gt;, etc, etc.&amp;nbsp; If you want my opinion on this subject, it is that - alas - there is no way of becoming reasonable, other than to be reasonable.&amp;nbsp; Reason is wisdom.&amp;nbsp; There is no formula for wisdom - and of all unwise beliefs, the belief that wisdom can be reduced to a formula, a prayer chant, a mantra, whatever, is the most ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know a lot of people involved in Less Wrong and I have a lot of sympathy.&amp;nbsp; I even met its charismatic leader, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliezer_Yudkowsky&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Eliezer Yudkowsky&lt;/a&gt;, once.&amp;nbsp; For a reason which at the time I couldn&#39;t quite place, he made me think immediately of a historical figure: &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabbatai_Zevi&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Shabbatai Zvi&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; But why?&amp;nbsp; Reading through the comments on Mr. Jones&#39; article, I finally realized why:&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;Eliezer Yudkowsky of the Machine Intelligence Research Institute here. [...]  &quot;More Right&quot; is not any kind of acknowledged offspring of Less Wrong nor is it so much as linked to by the Less Wrong site.  We are not part of a neoreactionary conspiracy.  We are and have been explicitly pro-Enlightenment, as such, under that name.  Should it be the case that any neoreactionary is citing me as a supporter of their ideas, I was never asked and never gave my consent.  Some kind of note in the article to this effect seems appropriate.  Thanks.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Also to be clear: I try not to dismiss ideas out of hand due to fear of public unpopularity. However I found Scott Alexander&#39;s takedown of neoreaction convincing and thus I shrugged and didn&#39;t bother to investigate further.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Indeed! That one certainly comes through loud and clear.&amp;nbsp; In related news, Shabbatai Zvi did not become a Muslim because the Sultan threatened to chop off his head.&amp;nbsp; No, it was because he found the Koran convincing.&amp;nbsp; He had certainly never heard of Islam before October 20, 2013.&amp;nbsp; But once he did, wow, Islam!&amp;nbsp; Poor Shabbatai - I&#39;m still trying to work my way through &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Baqara&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&quot;The Cow.&quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look, it&#39;s no secret why people believe in the revolution.&amp;nbsp; The revolution is powerful.&amp;nbsp; Eliezer Yudowsky is, without doubt, rational, and it is the highest form of rationality to serve power.&amp;nbsp; By doing so, one serves oneself, and what could be more rational?&amp;nbsp; As a bit of a cult leader myself, I declare that Less Wrong will now and hereafter be known as &quot;Less Wrongthink.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yet, because one has to lie to oneself to serve a lie, there are certain tics and insanities that actually affect one&#39;s daily life.&amp;nbsp; Take Scott Alexander - who is, in fact, a psychiatrist by trade.&amp;nbsp; Surely he agrees with my definition of insanity: living and acting in a world that is not the real one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would much rather criticize his other posts than his gargantuan FAQ, because I think they are more interesting and illustrative.&amp;nbsp; The other day he posted &lt;a href=&quot;http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/11/26/a-letter-i-will-probably-send-to-the-fda/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; I quite liked - about FDA&#39;s (insiders say &quot;FDA,&quot; not &quot;the FDA&quot;) decision to kill &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/elements/2013/11/the-fda-vs-personal-genetic-testing.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;consumer genetic testing&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;-webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;

As a doctor...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Alexander goes on for many paragraphs in a voice of perfect reason.&amp;nbsp; Everything he says is true, right, politely and elegantly stated, etc, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;Apple-interchange-newline&quot; /&gt;Which is exactly the problem.&amp;nbsp; First of all, this is a person who believes - ostensibly - in democracy.&amp;nbsp; In other words, historically speaking, he is insane.&amp;nbsp; Yet his actions bespeak actual sanity, because they bespeak an actual, practical knowledge that he is not living in a democracy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;Apple-interchange-newline&quot; /&gt;Alexander sees that his government has made a bad, stupid, irrational and really downright evil decision.&amp;nbsp; But he does not go out and try to convince his readers (all 10,000 of them, perhaps) to &lt;i&gt;vote&lt;/i&gt; differently.&amp;nbsp; In his &lt;i&gt;actions&lt;/i&gt;, he reveals that he&#39;s perfectly aware that this highly touted failsafe mechanism against bad government, always and everywhere, &lt;i&gt;does not in fact exist&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That, in fact, the elected officials of American democracy have &lt;a href=&quot;http://foseti.wordpress.com/2011/02/02/on-government-employment/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;little or no effective control&lt;/a&gt; over the actual agencies of USG - and if these elected officials in fact ceased to exist, USG would continue as it is.&amp;nbsp; In fact, to anyone who knows Washington, it&#39;s quite clear that USG would work not only just as well without a Congress or White House, but in fact somewhat better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;Apple-interchange-newline&quot; /&gt;Instead, following &lt;a href=&quot;http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2010/11/democracy-cis-and-trans-maines-law.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Maine&#39;s law&lt;/a&gt;, Alexander adopts the oldest &lt;i&gt;monarchical&lt;/i&gt; method of correcting abuses.&amp;nbsp; That is, of course, &lt;i&gt;petitioning the king&lt;/i&gt;. But there is one little problem here - which still reveals some actual insanity.&amp;nbsp; Namely, Alexander suffers under the terrible delusion that someone in Washington &lt;i&gt;cares what he thinks&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually he does not think of himself as addressing his letter to &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Hamburg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Margaret Hamburg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI-m2Cucdoo&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Jeffrey Shuren &lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/Transparency/Basics/ucm195692.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Alberto Gutierrez&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; These actual, individual human beings, whose government (in this matter) is no less absolute than any king, are unlike a king anonymous and mysterious.&amp;nbsp; If he had a king, he would actually know who the king &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Moreover, he would have some reason to know whether the king was actually someone who &lt;i&gt;cared at all what he thought&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually I suspect that Alexander does not sees himself as ruled (in this matter) by these individual human beings.&amp;nbsp; I suspect he sees himself as ruled by an &lt;i&gt;abstraction&lt;/i&gt;, in this case &lt;i&gt;Science.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/i&gt;Who wouldn&#39;t want to be governed by Science?&amp;nbsp; Again we see Maine&#39;s law in action - consider the number of monarchies that have convinced their subjects that they are not ruled by a man, but governed by God.&amp;nbsp; God, of course, listens only to prayers.&amp;nbsp; Science hears open letters, especially when sent by a scientist.&amp;nbsp; And so on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But in fact, these human beings are what they are - bureaucrats.&amp;nbsp; Their stated reason for killing genetic testing is a deep, sincere concern for the health of Americans.&amp;nbsp; But it&#39;s curious, isn&#39;t it?&amp;nbsp; If they are reasonable and motivated by this concern - Scott Alexander&#39;s points aren&#39;t exactly recondite.&amp;nbsp; Surely the King, oops, the Commissioner, has thought about this matter?&amp;nbsp; What could possibly impede Margaret Hamburg, Jeffrey Shuren and Alberto Gutierrez from noticing these obvious arguments?&amp;nbsp; Can it be... that they haven&#39;t been reading Less Wrong?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course not.&amp;nbsp; Actually, the most parsimonious explanation is that since they&#39;re bureaucrats, they care about the one thing almost all bureaucrats care about: power.&amp;nbsp; By acting effectively, by smashing something and getting away with it, they display their power and their testicles (or ovaries) expand.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s basic chimpanzee ethology, also applied to our strange mutant human clade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If we have to ask (in the real world, where we are ruled by human beings, not the imaginary world where we are ruled by Reason itself) &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt; FDA killed 23, the answer might well be quite familiar to the court of Versailles.&amp;nbsp; Namely, Sergey Brin (no relation to David), has found something younger to boff, and 23 has found itself deprived of its &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/hockey/mafia/csis.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;krysha&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; I don&#39;t know.&amp;nbsp; It could be true.&amp;nbsp; Or not.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m just speculating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But in the real world where we actually live, what is the easiest way to get rid of Messrs.&amp;nbsp; Hamburg, Shuren and Gutierrez?&amp;nbsp; Is it... an election?&amp;nbsp; Um, these are permanent civil servants, &quot;We the People&quot; don&#39;t have the power to fire them.&amp;nbsp; Or to elect anyone who can fire them.&amp;nbsp; Or... really any power at all, when it comes down to it.&amp;nbsp; So, if USG is abusing its power - what?&amp;nbsp; What is your real-world course of action?&amp;nbsp; What can USG be replaced with?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have an answer, actually.&amp;nbsp;

It was a lot easier than being a fascist screenwriter.&amp;nbsp; Or even an anticommunist screenwriter.&amp;nbsp; (Same thing, right?)&amp;nbsp; And as any pathetic last shreds of real opposition shrink and die off, the Scare only grows.&amp;nbsp; That&#39;s how winners play it.&amp;nbsp; That&#39;s just how the permanent revolution rolls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not that valiant philosophical efforts haven&#39;t been made, such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.popehat.com/2013/09/10/speech-and-consequences/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;, to distinguish between witch hunts and witch hunts.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Apparently Popehat, though he claims to be some sort of a legal scholar and definitely has strong and (more unusually) sincere opinions about free speech, has never heard of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Channels&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Red Channels&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lib.utexas.edu/taro/utcah/01497/cah-01497.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Faulk v. AWARE&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s not clear whether he (a) thinks the Hollywood blacklist was a fine idea, (b) believes it was enforced by the FBI, or (c) considers it laudable to purge fascists but horrible to purge communists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Update: with eerie, beautiful historical fidelity, Anil Dash &lt;a href=&quot;http://dashes.com/anil/2013/09/my-meeting-with-pax.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;channels&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;Red Channels&lt;/i&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;There was also a pretty dogged pitch for his film, which will get all kinds of warm huzzahs from the intersection of atheists, pacifists, communists and Jews.&amp;nbsp; I was pretty amazed that he went for it. He flat out said that he wants his film to be funded and wasn&#39;t sure if it&#39;d be possible after all of his, and I replied that it realistically wasn&#39;t going to happen without the say-so of someone like me, and I wasn&#39;t inclined to give some producer the nod on this.&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;On reflection, I&#39;ll be explicit: If you&#39;re a producer, and you invest in Dalton Trumbo&#39;s film without a profound, meaningful and years-long demonstration of responsibility from Dalton beforehand, you&#39;re complicit in extending the film industry&#39;s awful track record of communism, and it&#39;s unacceptable.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;It is also wonderful to see the enormous cognitive load which besets the liberal mind when asked to decide whether it&#39;s the overdog or the underdog.&amp;nbsp; All the CPUs max out, the fan goes crazy and the case could cook an egg.&amp;nbsp; The whole post is worth reading - in the author&#39;s own humble words, it&#39;s the very image of &quot;positive, ambitious, thoughtful, inclusive, curious, empathetic and self-aware.&quot;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Memo to Popehat: most of what we call &quot;McCarthyism&quot; was a matter of &quot;social consequences.&quot;&amp;nbsp; Besides, the social consequences work for one and only one reason: there&#39;s an iron fist in the velvet glove. Being sued for disrespecting a privileged class - excuse me, a &lt;i&gt;protected&lt;/i&gt; class - is not in any way a social consequence, but rather a &lt;i&gt;political&lt;/i&gt; one.&amp;nbsp; Hey, while we&#39;re chatting, could you remind me exactly how Warren Court jurisprudence derived the &quot;protected class&quot; from &quot;equal protection of law?&quot;&amp;nbsp; I know the theory, actually - but it&#39;d be fun to see you explain it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, ain&#39;t nothin&#39; new here.&amp;nbsp; For quite some time in America it&#39;s been illegal to employ racists, sexists and fascists, and mandatory to employ a precisely calibrated percentage of women, workers and peasants.&amp;nbsp; Because America is a free country and that&#39;s what freedom &lt;i&gt;means&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But &quot;technology,&quot; defined broadly as anything new and cool that happens in California, has been in practice exempt from these restrictions.&amp;nbsp; The elite, especially a productive elite, always enjoys a special level of tolerance.&amp;nbsp; I once asked a Googler: which population, from his unscientific experience alone, does Google employ more of?&amp;nbsp; African-Americans, or Serbs?&amp;nbsp; &quot;You must be joking,&quot; he said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Google, of course, claims the fact that it would rather hire out of East Bosnia than East Palo Alto is a &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mbrt.net/2013/press/0408.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;competitive trade secret&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Well, I suppose.&amp;nbsp; Curiously enough, Apple, Yahoo, and Oracle share &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/tech/Google-Dont-Be-Hypocritical-84405122.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the same secret&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Ha, ha!&amp;nbsp; Is it a secret to you?&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s not a &lt;a href=&quot;http://westhunt.wordpress.com/2013/08/31/it-must-be-said/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;secret&lt;/a&gt; to me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You know, Goog, once you start lying, there&#39;s really no end to it.&amp;nbsp; For one thing, even if your enemies ignore lying, defensive evasion, and other telltale &quot;beta&quot; behaviors, they still own you.&amp;nbsp; They&#39;ve just decided not to eat you just yet, maybe in the hopes that you&#39;re still getting fatter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in a way I actually like to see the #BrownScare getting big in Silicon Valley, because I think there&#39;s a lot of potential for opposing it here.&amp;nbsp; A lot of wasted potential.&amp;nbsp; Which will probably remain wasted, but why not try, eh?&amp;nbsp; Dear fellow geeks, there&#39;s no need to get purged.&amp;nbsp; Your predator, though powerful, is not complicated, and not that hard to hack if you&#39;re careful.&amp;nbsp; Indeed, properly organized, you may even be able to overcome him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s actually not hard to explain the Brown Scare.&amp;nbsp; Like all witch hunts, it&#39;s built on a &lt;i&gt;conspiracy theory&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; The Red Scare was based on a conspiracy theory too, but at least it was a real conspiracy with real witches - two of whom were my father&#39;s parents.&amp;nbsp; (The nicest people on earth, as people.&amp;nbsp; I like to think of them not as worshipping Stalin, but worshipping what they thought Stalin was.)&amp;nbsp; Moreover, the Red Scare was a largely &lt;i&gt;demotic&lt;/i&gt; or peasant phenomenon to which America&#39;s governing intellectual classes were, for obvious reasons, immune.&amp;nbsp; Because power works and &lt;a href=&quot;http://washingtonexaminer.com/article/1154466&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;culture is downstream from politics&lt;/a&gt; - real politics, at least - the Red Scare soon faded into a joke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/40399768?uid=2129&amp;amp;uid=2&amp;amp;uid=70&amp;amp;uid=4&amp;amp;sid=21102646840193&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;mainstream&lt;/i&gt; conspiracy theory&lt;/a&gt;, fully in the institutional saddle, the Brown Scare is far greater and more terrifying.&amp;nbsp; Unfortunately no central statistics are kept, but I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if every day in America, more racists, fascists and sexists are detected, purged and destroyed, than all the screenwriters who had to prosper under pseudonyms in the &#39;50s.&amp;nbsp; Indeed it&#39;s not an exaggeration to say that hundreds of thousands of Americans, perhaps even a million, are employed in one arm or another of this ideological apparatus.&amp;nbsp; Cleaning it up will require a genuine cultural revolution - or a cultural reaction, anyway.&amp;nbsp; Hey, Americans, I&#39;m ready whenever you are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The logic of the witch hunter is simple.&amp;nbsp; It has hardly changed since &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Hopkins&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Matthew Hopkins&#39;&lt;/a&gt; day.&amp;nbsp; The first requirement is to &lt;i&gt;invert the reality of power&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Power at its most basic level is the power to harm or destroy other human beings.&amp;nbsp; The obvious reality is that witch hunters gang up and destroy witches. Whereas witches are never, ever seen to gang up and destroy witch hunters.&amp;nbsp; By this test alone, we can see that the conspiracy is imaginary (Brown Scare) rather than real (Red Scare).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Think about it.&amp;nbsp; Obviously, if the witches had any power whatsoever, they wouldn&#39;t waste their time gallivanting around on broomsticks, fellating Satan and cursing cows with sour milk.&amp;nbsp; They&#39;re getting burned right and left, for Christ&#39;s sake!&amp;nbsp; Priorities!&amp;nbsp; No, they&#39;d turn the tables and lay some serious voodoo on the witch-hunters.&amp;nbsp; In a country where anyone who speaks out against the witches is soon found dangling by his heels from an oak at midnight with his head &lt;i&gt;shrunk to the size of a baseball&lt;/i&gt;, we won&#39;t see a lot of witch-hunting and we know there&#39;s a serious witch problem.&amp;nbsp; In a country where witch-hunting is a stable and lucrative career, and also an amateur pastime enjoyed by millions of hobbyists on the weekend, we know there are no real witches worth a damn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We do not see &lt;a href=&quot;http://valleywag.gawker.com/the-bigoted-cto-is-out-at-business-insider-1283924796&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Pax Dickinson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://valleywag.gawker.com/dear-paul-graham-your-priorities-are-so-far-out-of-wha-1228175284&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Paul Graham&lt;/a&gt; ganging up to destroy Gawker.&amp;nbsp; We see them curling up into a fetal position and trying to survive.&amp;nbsp; An America in which hackers could purge journalists for communist deviation, rather than journalists purging hackers for fascist deviation, would be a very different America.&amp;nbsp; Ya think?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whereas the real America, the America in which a journalist &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.linkedin.com/in/nitashatiku&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;little more than an intern&lt;/a&gt;, with no discernible achievements but a sharp tongue, a Columbia degree and &lt;a href=&quot;http://valleywag.gawker.com/culture-fit-is-a-shitty-excuse-for-marginalizing-wome-1186914306&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;trouble using MySQL&lt;/a&gt;, can quite effectively bully one of the most accomplished hackers of his era, not to mention a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.paulgraham.com/say.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;way better writer&lt;/a&gt; - this is the remarkable America that we live in and need to explain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This phenomenon of spoiled children systematically bullying their elders and betters reminds us, of course, of Mao.&amp;nbsp; But still more, of Plato.&amp;nbsp; Do they still read Plato at Columbia?&amp;nbsp; Ha, that&#39;s very funny.&amp;nbsp; Plato!&amp;nbsp; Gawker may not know Plato, but &lt;a href=&quot;http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/republic.9.viii.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Plato knows Gawker&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Yes, he said; that is the way with him. &lt;br /&gt;Yes, I said, he lives from day to day indulging the appetite of the hour; and sometimes he is lapped in drink and strains of the flute; then he becomes a water-drinker, and tries to get thin; then he takes a turn at gymnastics; sometimes idling and neglecting everything, then once more living the life of a philosopher; often he-is busy with politics, and starts to his feet and says and does whatever comes into his head; and, if he is emulous of any one who is a warrior, off he is in that direction, or of men of business, once more in that. His life has neither law nor order; and this distracted existence he terms joy and bliss and freedom; and so he goes on. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, he replied, he is all liberty and equality. &lt;br /&gt;Yes, I said; his life is motley and manifold and an epitome of the lives of many; --he answers to the State which we described as fair and spangled. And many a man and many a woman will take him for their pattern, and many a constitution and many an example of manners is contained in him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just so. &lt;br /&gt;Let him then be set over against democracy; he may truly be called the democratic man. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let that be his place, he said. &lt;br /&gt;Last of all comes the most beautiful of all, man and State alike, tyranny and the tyrant; these we have now to consider. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quite true, he said. &lt;br /&gt;Say then, my friend, in what manner does tyranny arise? --that it has a democratic origin is evident. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clearly. &lt;br /&gt;And does not tyranny spring from democracy in the same manner as democracy from oligarchy --I mean, after a sort? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How? &lt;br /&gt;The good which oligarchy proposed to itself and the means by which it was maintained was excess of wealth --am I not right? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes. &lt;br /&gt;And the insatiable desire of wealth and the neglect of all other things for the sake of money-getting was also the ruin of oligarchy? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;True. &lt;br /&gt;And democracy has her own good, of which the insatiable desire brings her to dissolution? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What good? &lt;br /&gt;Freedom, I replied; which, as they tell you in a democracy, is the glory of the State --and that therefore in a democracy alone will the freeman of nature deign to dwell. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes; the saying is in everybody&#39;s mouth. &lt;br /&gt;I was going to observe, that the insatiable desire of this and the neglect of other things introduces the change in democracy, which occasions a demand for tyranny. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How so? &lt;br /&gt;When a democracy which is thirsting for freedom has evil cupbearers presiding over the feast, and has drunk too deeply of the strong wine of freedom, then, unless her rulers are very amenable and give a plentiful draught, she calls them to account and punishes them, and says that they are cursed oligarchs. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, he replied, a very common occurrence. &lt;br /&gt;Yes, I said; and loyal citizens are insultingly termed by her slaves who hug their chains and men of naught; she would have subjects who are like rulers, and rulers who are like subjects: these are men after her own heart, whom she praises and honours both in private and public. Now, in such a State, can liberty have any limit? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Certainly not. &lt;br /&gt;By degrees the anarchy finds a way into private houses, and ends by getting among the animals and infecting them. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How do you mean? &lt;br /&gt;I mean that the father grows accustomed to descend to the level of his sons and to fear them, and the son is on a level with his father, he having no respect or reverence for either of his parents; and this is his freedom, and the metic is equal with the citizen and the citizen with the metic, and the stranger is quite as good as either. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, he said, that is the way. &lt;br /&gt;And these are not the only evils, I said --there are several lesser ones: In such a state of society the master fears and flatters his scholars, and the scholars despise their masters and tutors; young and old are all alike; and the young man is on a level with the old, and is ready to compete with him in word or deed; and old men condescend to the young and are full of pleasantry and gaiety; they are loth to be thought morose and authoritative, and therefore they adopt the manners of the young. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why not, as Aeschylus says, utter the word which rises to our lips? &lt;br /&gt;That is what I am doing, I replied; and I must add that no one who does not know would believe, how much greater is the liberty which the animals who are under the dominion of man have in a democracy than in any other State: for truly, the she-dogs, as the proverb says, are as good as their she-mistresses, and the horses and asses have a way of marching along with all the rights and dignities of freemen; and they will run at anybody who comes in their way if he does not leave the road clear for them: and all things are just ready to burst with liberty. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I take a country walk, he said, I often experience what you describe. You and I have dreamed the same thing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And above all, I said, and as the result of all, see how sensitive the citizens become; they chafe impatiently at the least touch of authority and at length, as you know, they cease to care even for the laws, written or unwritten; they will have no one over them. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, he said, I know it too well. &lt;br /&gt;Such, my friend, I said, is the fair and glorious beginning out of which springs tyranny. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glorious indeed, he said. But what is the next step? &lt;br /&gt;The ruin of oligarchy is the ruin of democracy; the same disease magnified and intensified by liberty overmasters democracy --the truth being that the excessive increase of anything often causes a reaction in the opposite direction; and this is the case not only in the seasons and in vegetable and animal life, but above all in forms of government. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blogger.com/null&quot; name=&quot;901&quot; style=&quot;-webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;

This fantasy is expertly constructed and appears quite real to the casual observer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The primary technique is to present the natural order of human society, which the revolution has in fact totally overthrown - an order in which the young respect the old, the inexperienced follow the accomplished, and dogs obey their owners - as the &lt;i&gt;existing&lt;/i&gt; order.&amp;nbsp; The professional witch-hunter, who is in fact a petty bureaucrat, a tool of power and a bully for hire, appears to himself as a sort of daring rebel against the great conspiracy.&amp;nbsp; Moreover, because this natural order both used to exist, and is always striving to spring up against Horace&#39;s pitchfork, it can be portrayed as the ruling order with great fictional nuance and detail - even after a half-century plus of permanent revolution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Furthermore, if you can present a natural force as a &lt;i&gt;human&lt;/i&gt; force, it is possible to attribute almost infinite power to the witch conspiracy.&amp;nbsp; Jews, for example, cause droughts.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s easy to see how strong the Jews are - it hasn&#39;t rained for a month!&amp;nbsp; Throw the Jews down the well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this particular case, it&#39;s an observation only slightly more obvious than that the sky is blue - especially for those of us who are grownups not born in the 1990s, with, like, wives and daughters and stuff - that (a) geeks are born not made, and (b) a Y chromosome is a major risk factor for geekiness.&amp;nbsp; In other words, we are not &lt;a href=&quot;http://heartiste.wordpress.com/2013/02/24/the-equalist-mantra/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;equalists&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;d certainly love it if everyone was equal (hopefully leveling up, not leveling down).&amp;nbsp; But we&#39;re not &lt;i&gt;insane&lt;/i&gt; and don&#39;t argue with reality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For example, I&#39;m a geek and I&#39;d love it if my daughter was a geek too.&amp;nbsp; She isn&#39;t.&amp;nbsp; Not only is she more girly than me, she&#39;s more girly than her mother (who has an EE degree).&amp;nbsp; She&#39;s reading Lemony Snicket in kindergarten, but she&#39;s not a geek.&amp;nbsp; A friend of mine has a daughter, about the same age, about as smart, who is a geek.&amp;nbsp; I wish my daughter cared about numbers, planets and dinosaurs.&amp;nbsp; For all I know, my friend wishes his daughter was a walking Disney Princess encyclopedia whose dolls can improvise an hour-long soap opera.&amp;nbsp; We can wish all we want, but that&#39;s &lt;i&gt;just not how it is&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; If I tried to impose my ideal daughter on the real person who reality decided would be my daughter, I would be a bad person and a bad parent.&amp;nbsp; And that&#39;s why I&#39;m a realist, not an equalist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the witchfinder can attribute the consequences of meteorology, biology, or any other department of reality to a human conspiracy, there is no limit to the proto-divine authority which the witch-cabal then assumes.&amp;nbsp; To rebel against it seems almost as daring and hopeless as a rebellion against God himself.&amp;nbsp; How romantic!&amp;nbsp; How empowering!&amp;nbsp; Smash the great conspiracy of differentness, without which we would all be gloriously the same!&amp;nbsp; Throw the Jews down the well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great technique.&amp;nbsp; But like all propaganda methods, it wears off.&amp;nbsp; Most people, most of the time, especially in an old worn-out post-democracy like our own, are extremely tired of politics, political philosophy, conspiracy theories, and the like.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s not exactly that they disagree with the party line.&amp;nbsp; But it no longer excites them.&amp;nbsp; It still excites a ruling minority, of course, and quite vociferously indeed.&amp;nbsp; (The Gawker comment threads, like those of every other party-line board, are full of &lt;i&gt;amateur&lt;/i&gt; bullies who derive great apparent pleasure, if not profit, from piling on.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What the bully needs is to provoke&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;mild&lt;/i&gt; approval, from the vast majority of ordinary, decent people who don&#39;t care about politics or power and are really not involved with the game at all.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s this abuse of common decency that offends me most about the witch-hunting process.&amp;nbsp; The ordinary observer does not, really, believe in witches - or disbelieve in them, either.&amp;nbsp; Rhetoric about black cats, third nipples and secret meetings with Satan doesn&#39;t make much impression on her at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what she knows is that Goody Hannah is a strange, mean old lady with no husband and a snippy tongue, who smells funny and sleeps way too late in the morning, and once yelled at her when she was a little girl.&amp;nbsp; Left to her own devices, our decent observer would never think of reasoning from this to the proposition that Goody Hannah needs to be drowned.&amp;nbsp; On the other hand, when the crowd (consisting mostly of decent observers) is about to drown Goody Hannah, she&#39;s not exactly about to speak up and stick out her neck.&amp;nbsp; For a strange, mean old lady with no husband and a snippy tongue?&amp;nbsp; That no one speaks up, of course, is no more and no less than the witchfinders need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clearly, everyone should be nice and no one should have a snippy tongue.&amp;nbsp; We often hear the word &lt;i&gt;offensive&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; What is an offensive person?&amp;nbsp; In a word, an asshole.&amp;nbsp; Everyone who hears this word (including Popehat - especially Popehat) should stop and think: is it illegal to be an asshole?&amp;nbsp; If so, why should it be illegal to be an asshole?&amp;nbsp; If not, why should it not be illegal to be an asshole?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Curiously, two thousand years before anyone had even heard of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microaggression&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&quot;microaggression,&quot;&lt;/a&gt; a bunch of old white guys called &quot;the Romans&quot; considered this issue and concluded: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=de+minimis+non+curat+lex&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;de minimis non curat lex&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Literally: &quot;the law does not concern itself with trifles.&quot;&amp;nbsp; Or metaphorically: no.&amp;nbsp; No, it is not, and should not be, illegal to be an asshole.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Think about the logic of a world in which it&#39;s illegal to be an asshole.&amp;nbsp; Or at least, in which one is liable for being an asshole.&amp;nbsp; Anyone could sue anyone else, at any time, for being an asshole.&amp;nbsp; In this world, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7zfnbdyAW8&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&quot;you dick&quot;&lt;/a&gt; isn&#39;t an insult.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s a &lt;i&gt;tort&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s a &lt;i&gt;factual claim&lt;/i&gt; that, if &lt;i&gt;proven true&lt;/i&gt; by a &lt;i&gt;court of law&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;pays damages&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, we know the Romans were a bunch of ignorant heteronormative dicks.&amp;nbsp; The Greeks, too!&amp;nbsp; Plato, Socrates, Aristotle... morons!&amp;nbsp; Ah, how far we&#39;ve come.&amp;nbsp; But really, why shouldn&#39;t Spicoli be able to sue Mr. Hand?&amp;nbsp; Who really was a dick, wasn&#39;t he?&amp;nbsp; Why should anyone be allowed to be a dick?&amp;nbsp; Why should that be okay, in our tolerant society?&amp;nbsp; To be a dick?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A legal system in which insolence is a tort has never, so far as I know, been tried.&amp;nbsp; In general, sages and jurists for all the world and time have agreed that, though it is not nice for people to be not nice to each other, the desirable goal of enforcing universal sweetness and niceness is simply not one within the reach of human jurisprudence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For one thing, the courtroom process relies on witness testimony, and even with eyewitnesses it is often difficult to establish who hit whom.&amp;nbsp; Imagine a lawsuit between two people, each of whom accuses the other of being a dick, but who were the only people in the room.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s preposterous.&amp;nbsp; No, clearly - the problem of giving dicks their just reward, which is neither jail time nor monetary damages, but simply social exclusion, is best left to Popehat&#39;s &quot;social consequences.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or so a bunch of dead old white dicks believed.&amp;nbsp; I mean, what the fuck, right?&amp;nbsp; Obviously, dead white dicks are going to believe it&#39;s okay to be a dick.&amp;nbsp; Duh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But a legal system in which rudeness &lt;i&gt;to certain people&lt;/i&gt; attracts the attention of the law... this system is by no means unusual in human history.&amp;nbsp; Nor is it universal.&amp;nbsp; But it&#39;s certainly the norm.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s really the Enlightenment system of uniform legal protection that&#39;s unusual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#39;s an example of the normal historical approach - from a non-Eurocentric context:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/rgUqk2tl31o&quot; width=&quot;420&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In old Japan, it wasn&#39;t illegal to be an asshole.&amp;nbsp; It wasn&#39;t even illegal to be an asshole to a samurai.&amp;nbsp; But it was illegal to be an asshole to a samurai - if you weren&#39;t a samurai.&amp;nbsp; See how it works?&amp;nbsp; You might say the samurai were a sort of &lt;i&gt;protected class&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; A system not at all unique to old Japan.&amp;nbsp; Always and everywhere, &quot;microaggressing&quot; against the protected class is hazardous to your health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was even a word, dating back to those same Roman dicks who gave us this &quot;de minimis&quot; bullshit, for a system of law that assigned certain people special rights.&amp;nbsp; This set of rights varied - but in almost every case, the right not to be offended (by those outside the subset) was the first and most basic.&amp;nbsp; The word, in fact, was &lt;i&gt;privilege&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Meaning, in Roman dick-speak, &lt;i&gt;private law&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Type it into the searchbar.&amp;nbsp; Somehow, you still get:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;A privilege is a special entitlement to immunity granted by the  state or another authority to a restricted group, either by birth or on a  conditional basis.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;I don&#39;t think I need to mention what the America of 2013 has done to this word. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hey, America - just to let you know - the language I speak, English, is actually older than you. (Not even counting the Roman bits.)&amp;nbsp; Hopefully it&#39;ll outlast you as well.&amp;nbsp; Maybe not.&amp;nbsp; But when you &lt;i&gt;rape&lt;/i&gt; it, you rape &lt;i&gt;my brain&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; And you know - unlike some people, I guess - I really don&#39;t get off on that.&amp;nbsp; Just to let you know, America.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the actual reality of a two-tier legal system, I don&#39;t mind it that much.&amp;nbsp; Really, it&#39;s historically normal.&amp;nbsp; For an example, consider this now classic tweet:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3xzq7r5PUtM/UjDgRAmvnII/AAAAAAAAAEo/tKhNbiX1ZDY/s1600/Screen+Shot+2013-09-11+at+2.26.44+PM.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;133&quot; src=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3xzq7r5PUtM/UjDgRAmvnII/AAAAAAAAAEo/tKhNbiX1ZDY/s320/Screen+Shot+2013-09-11+at+2.26.44+PM.png&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whom is it illegal to offend?&amp;nbsp; Well, for example, Pax (and his 50 re-tweeters - who should all also, of course, be investigated!&amp;nbsp; Any junior-league Matthew Hopkinses out there?&amp;nbsp; Gosh, Gawker has interns, don&#39;t it?) was satirizing &lt;a href=&quot;http://gawker.com/5577713/report-mel-gibson-uses-n+word-threatens-rape-of-wife&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mel Gibson&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Were Mel Gibson King of America (not my ideal outcome - but perhaps still preferable to present conditions), this would constitute actionably offensive speech in the form of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A8se-majest%C3%A9&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;lese-majeste&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; (Which is still a thing in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A8se_majest%C3%A9_in_Thailand&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Thailand&lt;/a&gt;, doncha know.)&amp;nbsp; Or, if America was a Christian country, this would be actionably offensive speech in the form of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blasphemy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;blasphemy&lt;/a&gt;, because Jesus is the Son of God and wouldn&#39;t just let Himself be ambushed from the rear like that.&amp;nbsp; Or...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But naturally our decent observer, pushing down again on the ducking stool as Goody Hannah struggles for air, cackling and shrieking exactly as a witch would, has no more conception of these power dynamics than a cat of tennis.&amp;nbsp; All she knows is that someone has said something &lt;i&gt;offensive&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Which is true.&amp;nbsp; Since she&#39;s not interested in the political patterns of who does and doesn&#39;t have the right not to be offended, her decent, good-natured desire that everyone should be nice to everyone else gets captured by the strong and used as a weapon against the weak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The world we live in is an awfully sick, cruel place, isn&#39;t it?&amp;nbsp; Well, we are all basically chimps.&amp;nbsp; You may not be interested in Power - but Power is interested in you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But we&#39;re still missing something... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because in any of these absurd hypotheticals, Pax is insulting the &lt;i&gt;governing class&lt;/i&gt; - the king, clergy, etc.&amp;nbsp; It is always a crime to insult Power, and we can take it for granted that Power has been insulted here.&amp;nbsp; And yet - we know who, specifically, has been actionably disrespected.&amp;nbsp; It ain&#39;t Jesus and it ain&#39;t Mel Gibson. It&#39;s African-Americans and prostitutes.&amp;nbsp; Or worse, women who dress like prostitutes - sadly a much larger set.&amp;nbsp; Fine - African-Americans and women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it&#39;s really not possible to contend that African-Americans and/or women are American&#39;s governing class.&amp;nbsp; This simply does not compute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which leaves us, for all our historical wisdom, at a sort of dead end.&amp;nbsp; What we&#39;re seeing here has never been seen before.&amp;nbsp; The privilege of not being offended, the most basic and customary privilege of nobility, after centuries of desuetude has been reinvented and regranted.&amp;nbsp; But the grantees have no resemblance to any traditional noble class.&amp;nbsp; Not only are they not a ruling class, they don&#39;t even seem... especially... &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thesmokinggun.com/buster/fourth-baltimore-beating-suspect-arrested-9784512&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;noble&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fine.&amp;nbsp; We have to go deeper into the rabbit hole.&amp;nbsp; You know that hit of acid?&amp;nbsp; The one you&#39;ve been saving?&amp;nbsp; For special emergencies?&amp;nbsp; Yo.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s time.&amp;nbsp; Come back in an hour when your tongue gets big.&amp;nbsp; (Not that there&#39;s anything really new here, of course, for the hardened UR addict.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I really have no brief for the Wachowski siblings, and the sequels prove there really is such a thing as accidental genius, genius remains genius and &lt;i&gt;The Matrix&lt;/i&gt; is its work.&amp;nbsp; You can&#39;t watch this scene too many times, especially if you&#39;re on acid:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/zE7PKRjrid4&quot; width=&quot;560&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out here on the right edge of the sane world, not quite yet in the ocean of madness but close enough to hear its cold black surf, there&#39;s a lot of talk about this Red Pill.&amp;nbsp; We of course live in the Matrix, or rather the &lt;a href=&quot;http://heartiste.wordpress.com/2013/09/09/the-nuts-and-bolts-of-cathedral-indoctrination/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Cathedral&lt;/a&gt; - I&#39;m glad to see this label catching on, though &quot;Matrix&quot; would do just as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But is there actually a Red Pill?&amp;nbsp; That will cure all this nonsense and explain everything, once and for all?&amp;nbsp; Acid is great, of course, but alas it &lt;i&gt;does&lt;/i&gt; wear off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;d like to believe the Red Pill is UR itself.&amp;nbsp; (There are a lot of blogs that get 500,000 views; there are a lot of blogs that get updated.&amp;nbsp; There are not a lot of blogs that get 500,000 views while not getting updated.)&amp;nbsp; But one would have to admit that it&#39;s a pretty big pill.&amp;nbsp; Keanu is going to be here all day and he&#39;ll need more than one glass of water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No. I think I&#39;ve chosen my candidate for the Pill itself.&amp;nbsp; And I&#39;m going to stick with it.&amp;nbsp; My Pill is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;America is a communist country.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;What I like about this statement is that it&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Empson&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ambiguous&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Specifically, it&#39;s an Empsonian ambiguity of the second or perhaps third type (I&#39;ve never quite understood the difference).&amp;nbsp; Embedded as it is in the mad tapestry of 20th-century history, &lt;i&gt;AIACC&lt;/i&gt; can be interpreted in countless ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of these interpretations - unless concocted as an intentional, obviously idiotic strawman - are absolutely true.&amp;nbsp; Sometimes they are obviously true, sometimes surprisingly true.&amp;nbsp; They are always true.&amp;nbsp; Because America is a communist country.&amp;nbsp; As we&#39;ll see...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously, as a normal American, or at least a normal American intellectual, this Red Pill strikes you as hilariously and obviously ridiculous and wrong.&amp;nbsp; You cannot even begin to process it as a serious hypothesis.&amp;nbsp; It is simply too stupid.&amp;nbsp; Right?&amp;nbsp; Right?&amp;nbsp; Bueller?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know two ways to answer this laugh: the fast way and the slow way.&amp;nbsp; The fast way: agree and amplify. &quot;That&#39;s right.&amp;nbsp; America is a communist country.&amp;nbsp; For workers and peasants, read: blacks and Hispanics.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may change to rage, fear, denial, whatever - but that laugh will suck itself right back down into the lungs.&amp;nbsp; That&#39;s what happens when you get punched.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can follow this punch (only punch if you need to, of course) by explaining to your erstwhile mugger &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt; he laughed.&amp;nbsp; More or less the rhetorical equivalent of kicking him when he&#39;s down.&amp;nbsp; As with the punch, only deliver the full treatment if it&#39;s really necessary.&amp;nbsp; Always be willing to accept surrender.&amp;nbsp; Ideally, you&#39;ll give your man a hand and he&#39;ll stand up and switch sides.&amp;nbsp; But of course, when it&#39;s time for the rhetorical ground-and-pound, it&#39;s time for the rhetorical ground-and-pound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The laugh got emitted because one of the simplest ingredients in your standard &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_pill&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Blue Pill&lt;/a&gt; is a trio of parallel antibodies that convert the Red Pill, in three different ways, into harmless idiotic strawmen.&amp;nbsp; Obviously, growing up in the Cathedral, we&#39;ve all received an enormous lifetime dose of Blue Pill.&amp;nbsp; Before we capture and study these antibodies, we can go no further.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first and most important antibody converts the RP into the perfect strawman:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;America is a Communist country.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Note the capital C.&amp;nbsp; Generally, the majuscule proper noun implies not the &lt;i&gt;general idea&lt;/i&gt; of communism, but the &lt;i&gt;specific entity&lt;/i&gt; that was the CPSU - and its various satellite organs, such as the CPUSA.&amp;nbsp; Hence, today, we read:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;America is secretly ruled from a secret Faraday cage under the White House by KGB Colonel-General Boris Borisov, who sometimes emerges in blackface to appear as &quot;Barack Obama.&quot;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;For example, Nazi Germany was a fascist country.&amp;nbsp; But Nazi Germany wasn&#39;t a Fascist country.&amp;nbsp; Nazi Germany was a fascist country because Hitler&#39;s political system was generally similar to Mussolini&#39;s.&amp;nbsp; But Nazi Germany wasn&#39;t a Fascist country - because Hitler wasn&#39;t a secret agent secretly working for Mussolini.&amp;nbsp; Get it?&amp;nbsp; Come on, of course you get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the small &#39;f&#39;, our sign signifies a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definitions_of_fascism&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;political system, ideology or movement,&lt;/a&gt; by its objective characteristics.&amp;nbsp; With the big &#39;F&#39;,&amp;nbsp; it signifies a political party, organization or regime, by its nominal identity.&amp;nbsp; You might find it hard to generalize this distinction to an earlier letter in the alphabet, if you are stupid, or haven&#39;t taken any semiotics classes.&amp;nbsp; Otherwise, it ought to be easy to see that though every Communist is a communist (adherent of the political system, ideology or movement), not every communist is a Communist (card-carrying disciple of MOSCOW!!!).&amp;nbsp; I mean, duh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This narrative of &lt;i&gt;international subversion &lt;/i&gt;is the most effective kind of propaganda strawman - a strawman that you can actually get your adversary to adopt.&amp;nbsp; An essentially nationalist, and utterly misguided, interpretation of the Communist Menace was the staple of the American right for the entire 20th century.&amp;nbsp; Indeed it &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dianawest.net/Home/tabid/36/EntryId/2656/PUBLISHED-THE-REBUTTAL-IN-THREE-PARTS.aspx&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;still sells books&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Not bad books - but never perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Historically, the subversion narrative of classical anticommunism is ridiculous as applied after 1989; generally wrong as applied after 1945; accurate in a sense between 1933 and 1945, but still generally misleading. (Alger Hiss is not Aldrich Ames; broadly speaking, the Americans involved with the Soviet security apparatus during the FDR period, including most likely FDR himself, saw themselves, correctly, as the senior rather than junior partners in the relationship - and considered their actions, though technically unlawful, unofficially authorized and the highest form of patriotism in spirit.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The basic problem with the outside agitator Commie subversion narrative is that it&#39;s way too optimistic.&amp;nbsp; Were communism some exotic pest, it would be easy to eradicate.&amp;nbsp; Perhaps we could find some kind of microscopic wasp that kept it in check in its strange foreign homeland.&amp;nbsp; Indeed, the usual pattern with an invasive species is that resistance to it is strongest in its &lt;a href=&quot;http://foseti.wordpress.com/2008/08/25/review-of-the-communistic-societies-of-the-united-states-by-charles-nordhoff/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;actual homeland&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For example, when we look at &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Reed_%28journalist%29&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;John Reed&#39;s&lt;/a&gt; short dramatic life, we see several epidemiological hypotheses - pick one:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Russian and Mexican revolutions have no connection; similarities are coincidental. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is one revolution, inherently Russian.&amp;nbsp; It spread, through America, to Mexico.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is one revolution, inherently Mexican.&amp;nbsp; It spread, through America, to Russia.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Russian and Mexican revolutions are connected via somewhere else - maybe Brazil?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Communism is as American as apple pie.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Of course, nationalist rhetoric - of a particularly virulent anti-American kind - was an essential ingredient in both the Russian and Mexican revolutions.&amp;nbsp; If the origin of these revolutions is essentially &lt;i&gt;foreign&lt;/i&gt; to the countries they devastated, it makes perfect sense that the lady would have no alternative but to protest too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s not foreign to ours, however, which explains why communism has only mildly devastated America.&amp;nbsp; No gulags here!&amp;nbsp; The home of the screwworm is also the home of the screwworm-eating wasp.&amp;nbsp; Unfortunately, one can&#39;t really rely on the wasp to eradicate the screwworm.&amp;nbsp; But it keeps the screwworms relatively sane, honest and under control, which is both a good thing and a bad thing.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s a good thing because it&#39;s a good thing.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s a bad thing because it makes it a lot easier for us to deny we have a communism problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the story of the 20th century is told in its proper, reactionary light, international communism is anything but a grievance of which Americans may complain.&amp;nbsp; Rather, it&#39;s a crime for which we have yet to repent.&amp;nbsp; Since America is a communist country, the original communist country, and the most powerful and important of communist countries, the crimes of communism are &lt;i&gt;our&lt;/i&gt; crimes.&amp;nbsp; You may not personally have supported these crimes.&amp;nbsp; Did you oppose them in any way?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The national guilt is especially strong, since our nation is anything but contrite.&amp;nbsp; Unlike our gelded pet Germans, we still believe in our national ideology of mass murder.&amp;nbsp; We ourselves are not murdering anyone right now, at least not a large scale.&amp;nbsp; But we did in the past, and we still believe the same beliefs that made us accessories, before and after the fact, to Soviet atrocities on an epic scale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the 20th century taught us anything, it taught us that it&#39;s not just the triggerman who&#39;s responsible for political murders.&amp;nbsp; The &lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Schreibtischtäter&lt;/i&gt; has also his place in the dock - and behind him stands the howling mob.&amp;nbsp; And &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_to_Moscow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mission to Moscow&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was not a flop.&amp;nbsp; Your grandparents watched it (mine did, anyway), and laughed and clapped.&amp;nbsp; Across the Atlantic they were laughing and clapping to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;mw-redirect&quot; href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jud_S%C3%BC%C3%9F_%28disambiguation%29&quot; title=&quot;Jud Süß (disambiguation)&quot;&gt;Jud Süss&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Man is Caliban, everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Consider one of America&#39;s most revered 20th-century writers.&amp;nbsp; I mean, of course, Ezra Pound.&amp;nbsp; No I don&#39;t - I mean Ernest Hemingway.&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.standpointmag.co.uk/node/764/full&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;According to George Plimpton&lt;/a&gt;, Hemingway liked to have a few daiquiris and then go watch Che mow down political prisoners with a machine gun.&amp;nbsp; Hem and Che both remain cult heroes worshipped by cool people everywhere.&amp;nbsp; Hey, what national guilt?&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s all cool, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heck, if the Nazis had pulled it out, we&#39;d wearing Reinhard Heydrich T-shirts instead.&amp;nbsp; Power, victorious power, is always and everywhere adored.&amp;nbsp; Its crimes?&amp;nbsp; Well, the winner always has some good excuse.&amp;nbsp; Who ever was prosecuted for Allied war crimes?&amp;nbsp; What war crimes?&amp;nbsp; Bueller?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cured of that antibody yet?&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s actually a second one:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;America is a communist country.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;is trivially translated, certainly if you&#39;re a communist (and we&#39;re all communists), to (in communist jargon):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;America has achieved communism.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Achieved!&amp;nbsp; Who said anything about achieved?&amp;nbsp; The Soviet Union was a communist country.&amp;nbsp; Right?&amp;nbsp; Did it achieve communism?&amp;nbsp; Did it even claim to have achieved communism?&amp;nbsp; Of course not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously, a communist believes that when communism is achieved, social, political and economic equality will be achieved.&amp;nbsp; In the Soviet Union, there were enormous social, political and economic inequalities.&amp;nbsp; In America, there are enormous social, political and economic inequalities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of these inequalities, a communist would say, with &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxer_%28Animal_Farm%29&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Boxer&lt;/a&gt; - we must work harder!&amp;nbsp; An anticommunist would say: of course you can&#39;t achieve these goals.&amp;nbsp; Communism creates enormous destruction while failing to advance at all toward its stated goals.&amp;nbsp; That&#39;s kind of why communism sucks so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moreover, it would seem obvious that, by taking the stance not that the failure to achieve communism means that communism doesn&#39;t work, but the stance that the failure to achieve communism means we haven&#39;t worked hard enough to achieve communism - you may not have chosen the best counter-argument against an anticommunist who irrationally persists in calling you a communist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes - America, original homeland and sole remaining capital of communism, is also the nation of hedge-fund billionaires in the Hamptons.&amp;nbsp; Actually, if you look closely, you&#39;ll see that for every libertarian billionaire there are ten &quot;progressive&quot; ones - with about twenty times as much money.&amp;nbsp; But hypocrisy, too, is as American as apple pie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But probably the most sophisticated antibody to &lt;i&gt;AIACC&lt;/i&gt; is the &lt;i&gt;dualist&lt;/i&gt; interpretation of communism.&amp;nbsp; The dualist believes that there are two kinds of leftism in the 20th century: moderate liberalism, which is as meek and mild as a spring lamb and wants nothing more than to rectify &quot;social injustice,&quot; and radical communism, a criminal deviation which sullies the name of the moderates by, you know, murdering hundreds of millions of people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This antibody is easily recognized as the logician&#39;s friend, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_true_Scotsman&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;No True Scotsman&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; No true Scotsman would massacre political prisoners.&amp;nbsp; If Scotsmen are found massacring political prisoners, they are found not to be true Scotsmen.&amp;nbsp; The fallacy is subtle - it is fallacious only because the distinction is manufactured as a consequence of the test.&amp;nbsp; For example, if we discovered that Highland Scots committed massacres and Lowland Scots did not, it would not be No True Scotsman, because the Highland/Lowland distinction exists objectively prior to the massacre/no-massacre distinction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s an interesting exercise to try to construct a meaningful and objective prior distinction between an American communist and an American liberal of the mid-to-late 20th-century.&amp;nbsp; For example, we could look for a partition of the social graph.&amp;nbsp; Perhaps liberals hate communism so much that they never invite communists to their parties?&amp;nbsp; Or fire them, for communist comments on Twitter?&amp;nbsp; We do see some partition between the moderate and extreme right - but if anything, it&#39;s the extreme left that tends to socially exclude the moderate left.&amp;nbsp; But not with enough consistency to make a good test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What, for example, is a &quot;progressive?&quot;&amp;nbsp; If the anti-communist liberal (as opposed to the anti-Communist, ie anti-Soviet, liberal - a very real phenomenon) was a real phenomenon, and viewed communists the same way he viewed Nazis, for their remarkably similar human rights offenses, we&#39;d expect him to avoid communist political terminology.&amp;nbsp; For much the same reason that, as cool as that glyph looks, you&#39;ll never ever see a swastika in an Apple ad. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whereas actually, codewords like &quot;progressive,&quot; &quot;social justice,&quot; &quot;change,&quot; etc, are shared across the Popular Front community for the entire 20th century.&amp;nbsp; They are just as likely to be used by a Cheka cheerleader from the &#39;20s, as a Clinton voter from the &#39;90s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dualist constructs his Scottish strawman as follows: Jimmy Carter is a vegetarian intellectual; Felix Dzerzhinsky was a cold-blooded killer.&amp;nbsp; Therefore, it is absurd to refer to both using the same label, for the same reason it is absurd to imagine Jimmy Carter snuffing out kulaks and reactionaries with a bullet in the nape of the neck.&amp;nbsp; Thus we create two categories of &quot;progressive,&quot; the &quot;nice progressive&quot; (who sounds like NPR) and the &quot;nasty progressive&quot; (with a bad Slavic growl).&amp;nbsp; And thus, since &quot;communist&quot; means &quot;nasty progressive,&quot; and there are no executions of dissidents and hence no nasty progressives in America... it is absurd to consider America as a communist country.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;True.&amp;nbsp; On the other hand, it is also absurd to imagine Rudolf Hess (a rather Carter-like personality) shooting anything larger than a rabbit.&amp;nbsp; No doubt, if the Nazis had won the war, the whole Holocaust thing would be considered an unfortunate (but understandable) aberration of Himmler and Heydrich.&amp;nbsp; (Hitler never put it in writing, very much for this purpose.)&amp;nbsp; No &lt;i&gt;true&lt;/i&gt; Nazi would do any such thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And indeed, most Nazis never hurt a single Jew.&amp;nbsp; And nonetheless it does not seem at all illogical to maintain a &lt;i&gt;monist&lt;/i&gt; interpretation of both Nazism and fascism, which does not separate fascists or Nazis into &quot;nice&quot; and &quot;nasty&quot; and exculpate the former from the crimes of the latter.&amp;nbsp; Indeed, much good ink is shed over the guilt of the innocent gullible Hitler voter.&amp;nbsp; Who&#39;d never even heard of Auschwitz, much less approved of it.&amp;nbsp; But guilty he remains, eh?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one at Gawker is shooting anyone in the nape of the neck.&amp;nbsp; On the other hand, no one at Gawker has the option to shoot anyone in the nape of the neck.&amp;nbsp; So we can&#39;t really know whether they would or they wouldn&#39;t, can we?&amp;nbsp; There sure does seem to be quite a bit of hate out there, however.&amp;nbsp; My guess is that most wouldn&#39;t, but some would.&amp;nbsp; And isn&#39;t some all it takes?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So - now that we know what American communism &lt;i&gt;isn&#39;t&lt;/i&gt;, let&#39;s look at what it &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Then we&#39;ll see what it gets out of purging people.&amp;nbsp; Then we&#39;ll see how to dodge the purge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, &lt;i&gt;communism&lt;/i&gt; is an ambiguous term and we can define it in any way.&amp;nbsp; One of the easiest ways to see why America is a communist country, for instance, is to define &lt;i&gt;communism&lt;/i&gt; as a cultural tradition, essentially a religion, which is transmitted through early nurture like a language.&amp;nbsp; Although languages are not, of course, encoded in our genes, they have an evolutionary history like that of genetic traits.&amp;nbsp; Englishmen are related to Germans, English is related to German.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Language and dialect diversity hasn&#39;t done well in the 20th century, but political and cultural traditions have taken the biggest hit of all.&amp;nbsp; Both worldwide and in America, the set of belief systems is far narrower in 2013 than in 1913.&amp;nbsp; Broadcast technology kind of does that.&amp;nbsp; Political and military developments have, of course, played a role as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What this means is that if you look for Americans in 1913 who have the same basic worldview of an ordinary American college student in 2013, you can find them.&amp;nbsp; But you can&#39;t find a lot of them.&amp;nbsp; The cultural mainstream of 2013 is not descended from the cultural mainstream of 1913, most of whose traditions are entirely extinct.&amp;nbsp; Rather, it is descended from a very small cultural aristocracy in 1913, whose bizarre, shocking and decadent tropes and behaviors are confined almost entirely to exclusive upper-crust circles found only in places such as Harvard and Greenwich Village.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What were these people called?&amp;nbsp; By themselves and others?&amp;nbsp; Communists, generally.&amp;nbsp; Though when they wanted to confuse outsiders, they&#39;d say &quot;progressive&quot; - and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cpusa.org/search/SphinxSearchForm?Search=progressive&amp;amp;action_results=Search&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;still do&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; But poking at this paper-thin euphemism, or any of its friends - &quot;radical,&quot; &quot;activist,&quot; and a thousand like it - is &quot;Red-baiting&quot; and &lt;i&gt;just not done&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; You&#39;ve got to respect the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kayfabe&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;kayfabe&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For example, my favorite example of a culturally ancestral aristo-American is &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Wentworth_Higginson&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Thomas Wentworth Higginson&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Higginson is best known for discovering Emily Dickinson, which may have been the only good deed he did.&amp;nbsp; But as a young man, he made pioneering strides in terrorist finance as a member of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_Six&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Secret Six&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; (If you have to get your balls groped at the airport, it&#39;s because America isn&#39;t your country.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s John Brown&#39;s country - you just live here.)&amp;nbsp; In the 1890s, he worked hard to promote &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_of_Friends_of_Russian_Freedom&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;revolution in Russia&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Some friends Russia had!&amp;nbsp; And as an old man, Higginson helped Jack London and Upton Sinclair start the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercollegiate_Socialist_Society&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Intercollegiate Socialist Society&lt;/a&gt;; which later became the awesomely named &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_for_Industrial_Democracy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;League for Industrial Democracy&lt;/a&gt;, which really should have been a band or at least a nightclub; which begat the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Students_for_a_Democratic_Society&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;SDS&lt;/a&gt;; which begat (shh!) &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Ayers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;B.H. Obama&lt;/a&gt;...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clearly, this is the authentic American tradition, unbroken and unchallenged.&amp;nbsp; Accept no substitutes!&amp;nbsp; And in fact, you can go to Google and read &lt;a href=&quot;http://books.google.com/books?id=JMfOKr3FB94C&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;T.W.&#39;s writing&lt;/a&gt;, and observe that for the most part it&#39;s fresh as a daisy and could be read on NPR tomorrow, without shocking or even surprising anyone.&amp;nbsp; In short - this is who we are.&amp;nbsp; Of course, we can go back to No True Scotsman, or any of our other fallacies, and argue that there&#39;s some sort of transcendental difference between a &quot;socialist&quot; and a &quot;communist.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;But really, why bother?&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s just obvious that we&#39;re &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2009/02/06/we-are-all-socialists-now.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;all communists now&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; communism?&amp;nbsp; A tradition, sure - but what is in the tradition?&amp;nbsp; Why does it work?&amp;nbsp; Why does it rule?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the terminology of the father of modern political science, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaetano_Mosca&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Gaetano Mosca&lt;/a&gt;, communism is a &lt;i&gt;political formula&lt;/i&gt; - a pattern of thinking that helps a subject support the organized minority that governs him.&amp;nbsp; Typically a modern political formula allows the subject to feel a sense of political power that convinces him that he is, in a sense, &lt;i&gt;part&lt;/i&gt; of the ruling minority, whether he is or not (usually not).&amp;nbsp; Since humans, and in fact all great apes in the chimp lineage, are political animals evolved to succeed in hierarchically ruled tribes, feeling powerful is deeply satisfying.&amp;nbsp; Communism works because it solves this problem, more effectively than any other political formula in wide distribution today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it comes to the formal governance process proper, of course, few are actually in the loop.&amp;nbsp; Just as pornography can stimulate the human sex drive without providing any actual sex, democracy can stimulate the human power drive without providing any actual power.&amp;nbsp; But one of the problems with American democracy today is that it&#39;s far too constant.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s like a single page ripped out of Playboy, pinned up in your prison cell.&amp;nbsp; Fifty years ago it was still enthralling, even though your forebrain may have known it was meaningless.&amp;nbsp; But eventually even your hindbrain figures out that it&#39;s just a piece of paper with some ink on it.&amp;nbsp; And it sure doesn&#39;t help that your forebrain knows the real lady in the picture, while real and actually female, is actually on Social Security by now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Witch-hunting on a purely informal basis, Popehat&#39;s &quot;social consequences,&quot; scratches the political perfectly, because of course here is &lt;i&gt;actual power&lt;/i&gt; - the power to harm other human beings - being exercised by ordinary people who are not mysterious DC bureaucrats.&amp;nbsp; Never, ever understate how fun it is to just chimp out for a minute.&amp;nbsp; If you mock it, it&#39;s because you&#39;ve never had a chance to be part of the mob.&amp;nbsp; You can condemn it as a vile, base passion, which of course it is - and a human passion as well.&amp;nbsp; We really all are Caliban.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But we have an angelic nature too, and our angelic forebrains need a cover story while the chimp hindbrain is busy biting off toes and testicles.&amp;nbsp; Pure sadism is enough for the id.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s not enough for the ego.&amp;nbsp; This is why we need communism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And what is communism?&amp;nbsp; As a political formula?&amp;nbsp; Perhaps we can define it, with a nice 20th-century social-science jargon edge, as &lt;i&gt;nonempathic altruism&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Or for a sharper pejorative edge, &lt;i&gt;callous altruism&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is callous altruism?&lt;i&gt;&amp;nbsp; Altruism&lt;/i&gt; itself is a piece of 20th-century jargon.&amp;nbsp; We could contrast it with the original word for the same thing, obviously too Christian to prosper in our age: &lt;i&gt;charity&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; When we say &lt;i&gt;charity&lt;/i&gt;, of course, we think of &lt;i&gt;empathic&lt;/i&gt; altruism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When we think of charity, we think not just of helping others - but of helping others whom we know and love, for whom we feel a genuine, unforged emotional connection.&amp;nbsp; For whom we feel, in a word, empathy.&amp;nbsp; Understandably, these people tend to be those who are socially close to us.&amp;nbsp; If not people we already know, they are people we would easily befriend if we met them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dickens, no stranger to genuine empathy, had a term for nonempathic altruism.&amp;nbsp; He called it &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://books.google.com/books?id=KlsJAAAAQAAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA24#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=telescopic%20philanthropy&amp;amp;f=false&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;telescopic philanthropy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Who is &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_altruism#Impartiality&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Peter Singer&lt;/a&gt;?&amp;nbsp; Mrs. Jellyby, with tenure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, for example, in classic Bolshevik communism, who is the revolution for?&amp;nbsp; The workers and peasants.&amp;nbsp; But... in classic Bolshevik communism... who actually makes the revolution?&amp;nbsp; Nobles (Lenin) and Jews (Trotsky), basically.&amp;nbsp; To wit, the groups in Russian society who are in fact most distant - emotionally, culturally, socially - from actual workers and peasants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Similarly, the most passionate anti-racists in America are all to be found, in early September, at Burning Man.&amp;nbsp; Everyone at Burning Man, with hardly an exception, is highly altruistic toward African-Americans.&amp;nbsp; But, to within an epsilon, there are &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.burningman.com/2012/01/uncategorized/is-burning-man-a-white-people-thing/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;no African-Americans at Burning Man. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;But wait, why is this wrong?&amp;nbsp; What&#39;s wrong with nonempathic altruism?&amp;nbsp; Why does it matter to the people being helped if the brains of their helpers genuinely light up in the love lobe, or not?&amp;nbsp; Loved or not, they&#39;re still helped - right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or are they?&amp;nbsp; How&#39;d that whole Soviet thing work out for the workers and peasants?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heck, for the last 50 years, one of the central purposes of American political life has been advancing the African-American community.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; And over the last four decades, what has happened to the African-American community?&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ll tell you one thing - in every major city in America, there&#39;s a burnt-out feral ghetto which, 50-years ago, was a thriving black business district.&amp;nbsp; On the other hand, there&#39;s a street in that ghetto named for Dr. King.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; So, there&#39;s that.&amp;nbsp; And since we mentioned Mrs. Jellyby, what exactly has a century of telescopic philanthropy done for Africa?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Are Gawker and its ilk genuinely interested in bringing &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_Technology&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;women into technology&lt;/a&gt;?&amp;nbsp; Do they genuinely like either (a) (other) women, or (b) technology?&amp;nbsp; Because it would sure seem, to the uneducated observer, that the &lt;i&gt;actual&lt;/i&gt; effect of their &lt;i&gt;actual&lt;/i&gt; actions is to &lt;i&gt;scare women away&lt;/i&gt; from programming careers - on the grounds that, if they so much as master MySQL, they will be instantly raped by a pack of Satan-worshipping &quot;brogrammers.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do you know what women who &lt;i&gt;actually&lt;/i&gt; want to help other women learn programming look like?&amp;nbsp; They look like &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.hackbrightacademy.com/2013/09/why-does-hackbright-academy-only-accept-women-into-the-engineering-fellowship-program/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Sexist, check.&amp;nbsp; Probably illegal, check.&amp;nbsp; Recognizing that women are different from men in more areas than the chest compartment, check.&amp;nbsp; (&quot;Men&#39;s rights&quot; activists, &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6370073&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;shut the fsck up!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; If you were real men and not communist pussies, you&#39;d know that no one has any rights, least of all you.&amp;nbsp; Only one thing makes right - that would be, of course, might - and whining that you&#39;re taking it in the tail, though taking it in the tail you are, is anything but a way to create &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt;.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(UC Berkeley when I was a grad student there had an excellent program, very similar, also (in practice) women-only, called the &lt;a href=&quot;http://people.mills.edu/spertus/Gender/reentry.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&quot;CS Reentry Program.&quot;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; I was ill-disposed to respect this program and the people in it, but reality quickly convinced me otherwise.&amp;nbsp; It was later done away with, for exactly this reason - communism has to pretend to be gender-neutral.&amp;nbsp; So it can&#39;t actually just help women by, you know, helping women.&amp;nbsp; That would involve appreciating women for what they are.&amp;nbsp; Which is obviously illegal in a communist country.&amp;nbsp; Similarly, once while decoding a Victorian book I told my daughter that in &quot;the old days,&quot; many girls went to schools where there were no boys.&amp;nbsp; She looked at me as though I&#39;d told her that in the old days, the whole world was made of chocolate.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can men be assholes to women?&amp;nbsp; Can women be assholes to men?&amp;nbsp; Well, actually, it&#39;s usually men who are assholes and women who are bitches - though not without exceptions.&amp;nbsp; But broadly speaking, can  everyone be assholes to everyone else?&amp;nbsp; They can.&amp;nbsp; They are.&amp;nbsp; And if you&#39;re  genuinely mentoring a younger person, with genuine empathy and a genuine interest in their genuine success, what you say in every case is: life is full  of assholes.&amp;nbsp; When someone is an asshole (or a bitch) to you, ignore him and have as little to do with him as possible.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you learn to recognize the distinction between empathic and nonempathic altruism, you&#39;ll see it everywhere.&amp;nbsp; Empathic altruism - charity - is simply good.&amp;nbsp; Nonempathic altruism - communism - is simply evil.&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s not a whole lot of gray area between good and evil.&amp;nbsp; Evil motivations can certainly, by coincidence, produce good results - but this is an accident, which has little or nothing to do with the supposed &quot;good intentions.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Consider our late lamented &quot;Arab Spring,&quot; a true &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.montypython.net/scripts/crunchy.php&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&quot;spring surprise&quot; &lt;/a&gt;that is creeping closer and closer to having killed a million people.&amp;nbsp; As Stalin said, of course, a million people is just a statistic.&amp;nbsp; You need a visual.&amp;nbsp; I like to work with Olympic swimming pools full of blood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And why did the Arab Spring happen?&amp;nbsp; It happened because our dear State Department incited revolutions across the Arab world.&amp;nbsp; And why did State do that?&amp;nbsp; They did it with the full-throated approval of the American people - all the American people, from left to right.&amp;nbsp; As far as I can recall, UR and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/MF01Ak01.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;David Goldman&lt;/a&gt; were the only two pundits condemning this enormous crime, which has produced exactly the results we expected.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;And what were the American people thinking?&amp;nbsp; They were in a pure state of callous altruism.&amp;nbsp; They thought, we&#39;ll &lt;i&gt;help&lt;/i&gt; our little brown Arab brothers by supporting them in their enlightened democratic revolution.&amp;nbsp; Mrs. Jellyby could not have expressed it better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you are motivated by genuine charity, and your charitable efforts backfire and actually harm the recipient of your help, you feel guilt and sorrow like nothing else.&amp;nbsp; You&#39;re a witness to a horrific motorcycle accident.&amp;nbsp; You run over to the man on the ground, pull his helmet off, hug him and give him CPR.&amp;nbsp; Unfortunately, he would have been fine, except that you just severed his spinal cord.&amp;nbsp; How do you feel?&amp;nbsp; Is your reaction: &quot;oh well, at least I tried?&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How did the American people react when their Arab experiment didn&#39;t go so well?&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ll tell you exactly how they reacted.&amp;nbsp; &quot;Oh well, at least we tried.&quot;&amp;nbsp; And then they changed the channel.&amp;nbsp; And that&#39;s what&#39;s wrong with callous altruism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, I&#39;ll be guilty of this same crime myself if I harp too much on the &quot;women and minorities hardest hit&quot; line.&amp;nbsp; What&#39;s really wrong with callous altruism?&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s a damned &lt;i&gt;lie&lt;/i&gt;, that&#39;s what&#39;s wrong with it.&amp;nbsp; It steals charity&#39;s good name and makes Randroids condemn charity and communism in the same breath.&amp;nbsp; And all for stupid political power, with which it does nothing.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m a grownup and don&#39;t need political formulas.&amp;nbsp; Order me to respect the Party, I&#39;ll respect the Party.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;ll tell you what the &lt;i&gt;real&lt;/i&gt; emotion behind the Arab Spring was.&amp;nbsp; Actually, Beavis can tell you better.&amp;nbsp; &quot;Fire is cool,&quot; said Beavis.&amp;nbsp; Fire is indeed cool.&amp;nbsp; Americans were bored and needed some better CNN.&amp;nbsp; They wanted to see shit burn.&amp;nbsp; Shit indeed burned, and is still burning.&amp;nbsp; Which was cool.&amp;nbsp; So they got what they wanted.&amp;nbsp; Not too different from the crowd in the Colosseum, just less honest about how they satisfy their very simple chimp/human needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it&#39;s not just sadism that motivates callous altruism.&amp;nbsp; Another source of venal satisfaction is that when you help people, or appear to help them, you become a patron.&amp;nbsp; You gain &lt;i&gt;ownership&lt;/i&gt; over them.&amp;nbsp; When you help overthrow the dictator of Egypt, for example, you become in a sense the new government of Egypt.&amp;nbsp; The old dictator was a strongman - the new dictator is a &lt;i&gt;weakman&lt;/i&gt;, because he owes his job to someone else.&amp;nbsp; That someone is you - the collective you, but you nonetheless.&amp;nbsp; If you decide you don&#39;t like your weakman, it&#39;s easy to find another weakman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fear that someone, somewhere, is exercising power over someone else, is one of the most basic cues of the callous-altruist mentality.&amp;nbsp; Let me kill the master and free the slave.&amp;nbsp; Out of altruism!&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Not sadism or ambition, of course.&amp;nbsp; My hands are pure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But slavery is simply dependence, and the default state of the newly &quot;freed&quot; slave is to be dependent on his new master - you, because you killed the old master.&amp;nbsp; So your sadism itch is scratched, because you get to kill; and your ambition itch is scratched, because you become a slavemaster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(A slavemaster?&amp;nbsp; You may not tell your dependent what to do all day.&amp;nbsp; But if you pay him to do nothing, he is still your slave - you may not ask him to work today, but you could tomorrow.&amp;nbsp; He would have to obey your commands or starve.&amp;nbsp; In other words, he&#39;s a slave.&amp;nbsp; And of course, there&#39;s one thing you&#39;ve surely bought - his vote.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Higginson and friends tried this experiment in the 1860s, roughly &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/11/books/sick-from-freedom-by-jim-downs-about-freed-slaves.html?pagewanted=all&amp;amp;_r=0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a fourth of the slaves&lt;/a&gt; died as a consequence of the operation.&amp;nbsp; Not to mention all the other people killed.&amp;nbsp; Naturally, since America is a communist country, this episode - which might under other regimes be viewed as an outbreak of mass criminal insanity - is considered one of the most glorious in our glorious history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And this is why you don&#39;t want to be a part of the lynch mob.&amp;nbsp; Even if you think there aren&#39;t enough women programmers and there should be more.&amp;nbsp; It is not your forebrain that lusts for power.&amp;nbsp; It is your hindbrain.&amp;nbsp; Forebrain... must... control... hindbrain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the mob&#39;s victims, who already understand this stuff - there&#39;s an easy way to not get purged.&amp;nbsp; Don&#39;t play the fool.&amp;nbsp; What is attacking you, though it seems like a frivolous phenomenon, is anything but.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; This is an active volcano which has claimed hundreds of millions of lives.&amp;nbsp; Just firing you is a small, small thing for it.&amp;nbsp; Just destroying your life - very easy.&amp;nbsp; Don&#39;t mess with it.&amp;nbsp; If you can avoid a fight with it, do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if you can&#39;t, don&#39;t be defensive.&amp;nbsp; Attack.&amp;nbsp; If possible, attack in depth and preemptively.&amp;nbsp; (What do you think I&#39;m doing here?)&amp;nbsp; One of the things that this evil machine is capable of, for example, is covering up hatefacts - &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=jonathan+foster+blowtorch&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;realities&lt;/a&gt; that embarrass it or contradict its narrative.&amp;nbsp; Your goal in attacking it is to embarrass and contradict it, creating a counter-narrative that it cannot incorporate into its own entertainment product.&amp;nbsp; If you succeed, &lt;i&gt;you will be covered up as well&lt;/i&gt; - which is exactly what you want.&amp;nbsp; So the purpose of your attack is not to draw attention, but to avoid attention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And finally, I have one last message for Gawker itself:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;At long last, bitch, have you no decency?&lt;/i&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/feeds/2706047756110358805/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7958140996781104565&amp;postID=2706047756110358805' title='267 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7958140996781104565/posts/default/2706047756110358805'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7958140996781104565/posts/default/2706047756110358805'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2013/09/technology-communism-and-brown-scare.html' title='Technology, communism and the Brown Scare'/><author><name>Mencius Moldbug</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/16472157249344139282</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3xzq7r5PUtM/UjDgRAmvnII/AAAAAAAAAEo/tKhNbiX1ZDY/s72-c/Screen+Shot+2013-09-11+at+2.26.44+PM.png" height="72" width="72"/><thr:total>267</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7958140996781104565.post-1971692008061277307</id><published>2013-06-20T03:11:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2013-06-20T03:12:43.540-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Civil liberties and the single reactionary</title><content type='html'>Single?&amp;nbsp;

and must &lt;i&gt;never ever change.&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp; Even when you&#39;re so old you can only pick up cougars.&amp;nbsp; I don&#39;t think I&#39;m the first real man to notice that &quot;PUA&quot;

target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;zip code 94114&lt;/a&gt;, in which pure alpha sexuality unrestrained by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thinkinghousewife.com/wp/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;womanly wisdom&lt;/a&gt; flames out from every other storefront.&amp;nbsp; Not that I&#39;m one to judge, but it seems to age poorly past 50.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, well, who cares?&amp;nbsp; Roissy is a sex addict and he knows it.&amp;nbsp; Hunter Thompson was a drug addict, and he knew it.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;d like to think my daughter (now reading Lemony Snicket in pre-K, thank you very much Mr. Galton) will read them both and draw the appropriate conclusions.&amp;nbsp; At least, when it comes to staying off the pole.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alas, I&#39;m here today to talk about a much less interesting subject: your so-called &quot;civil liberties.&quot;&amp;nbsp; While I really try not to notice these things, I can&#39;t help noticing that Americans have fallen into one of our routine moral panics that &lt;i&gt;We Are Losing Our Democracy&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Take comfort, kids.&amp;nbsp; You don&#39;t have one and nor did your grandpa.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I was interested in knowing why I should care about my &quot;civil liberties,&quot; I actually downloaded &lt;a href=&quot;http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=998565&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this legal paper&lt;/a&gt;, which is the &lt;i&gt;most popular download ever &lt;/i&gt;on SSRN.&amp;nbsp; Would the pox vopuli come through again?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I kept scanning for what exactly I had to fear.&amp;nbsp; Fortunately, thanks to my enormous brain, I have no trouble with glorious neoplatonic gnosticisms such as:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &#39;TimesNewRomanPSMT&#39;; font-size: 12.000000pt;&quot;&gt;Instead of being related by a common denominator, some things share “a complicated network of similarities overlapping and criss-crossing: sometimes overall similarities, sometimes similarities of detail.” In other words, privacy is not reducible to a singular essence; it is a plurality of different things that do not share one element in common but that nevertheless bear a resemblance to each other. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;or, even better,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &#39;TimesNewRomanPSMT&#39;; font-size: 12.000000pt;&quot;&gt;Accordingly, there are no clear boundaries for what we should call or should not refer to as “privacy.” Some might object to the lack of clear boundaries, but this objection assumes that having definitive boundaries matters. The quest for a traditional definition of “privacy” has led to a rather fruitless and unresolved debate. In the meantime, there are real problems that must be addressed, but they are either conflated or ignored, because they do not fit into various pre-fabricated conceptions of privacy. The law often neglects to see the problems and instead ignores all things that do not fall into a particular conception of “privacy.” In this way, conceptions of privacy can prevent the examination of problems. The problems still exist regardless of whether we classify them as being “privacy” problems. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The very stuff and substance of Talmudic discourse in any creed or age.&amp;nbsp; SSRN, alas, lacks the technology to measure customer engagement after download.&amp;nbsp; But I can&#39;t help suspecting that the completion rate on Professor Solove&#39;s &lt;i&gt;opus magnus&lt;/i&gt; resembles that of a Coursera course on Lacan.&amp;nbsp; Finally, on page 22, I found something concrete: apparently in the &#39;90s a couple of actresses were killed by stalkers who got their addresses from leaky government databases.&amp;nbsp; This is very tragic.&amp;nbsp; Of course, a few years later, 3000 people died &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fas.org/irp/eprint/wall.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;to protect&lt;/a&gt; Zacarias Moussaoui&#39;s &quot;civil liberties.&quot;&amp;nbsp; But I suppose this would be reducing privacy to a pre-fabricated conception of a singular essence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did emerge, like Mark Twain from his Germanic sentence, with the belief that the gnostic mystery of privacy has something to do with the gnostic mystery of democracy.&amp;nbsp; Privacy, in Professor Solove&#39;s wooly conception, would seem to be a &lt;i&gt;political&lt;/i&gt; right - that is, a right to power, masquerading as an immunity from power.&amp;nbsp; Hobbes&#39; &lt;a href=&quot;http://books.google.com/books?id=iaIdAAAAMAAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA29&amp;amp;dq=hobbes+wild+ass+desolate+freedom&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ei=VsDCUe25EsbiigKk2oDQBg&amp;amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=hobbes%20wild%20ass%20desolate%20freedom&amp;amp;f=false&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&quot;desolate freedom of the wild ass&quot;&lt;/a&gt; is never far off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just the way Roissy is a sex addict, the civil-liberties zealot is a power addict.&amp;nbsp; There is a difference, however.&amp;nbsp; Roissy actually has sex.&amp;nbsp; Or so I believe.&amp;nbsp; There is unfortunately no word that means &quot;porn&quot; in the context of political power, but there should be.&amp;nbsp; Being a slave to desire is a low condition of the human soul, but the only condition more pathetic is that of a slave to unfulfilled desire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, history is long.&amp;nbsp; Even the 20th century was long.&amp;nbsp; While the civil-liberties geek of 2013 is a pathetic and even hilarious figure, it&#39;s not at all true that his passion has never gone requited.&amp;nbsp; Actually, in its bureaucratic form, &quot;civil liberties&quot; helps keep the streets of San Francisco covered with turds and shambling zombies - two phenomena which constantly challenge and entertain my delightful precocious toddlers.&amp;nbsp; &quot;Why?&amp;nbsp; Why, Pop?&quot;&amp;nbsp; Alas, though precocious, my offspring are nowhere near precocious enough to absorb the concept of the ACLU.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ACLU!&amp;nbsp; This universally respected organization, of course, is the first institution we think of when we think of &quot;civil liberties.&quot;&amp;nbsp; The ACLU is all het up that the gubmint is readin&#39; yer emails.&amp;nbsp; Who could be against the ACLU?&amp;nbsp; Who but a crazy man?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well.&amp;nbsp; Does history matter, or doesn&#39;t it?&amp;nbsp; Here at UR, we believe it does.&amp;nbsp; In the history of the ACLU, one man looms large - &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Nash_Baldwin&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Roger Baldwin&lt;/a&gt;, who founded that universally respected institution in 1917 and remained its leader until 1950.&amp;nbsp; Could we use this one man as a test of American sincerity in our national love for civil liberties?&amp;nbsp; Are we all just a nation of concern trolls?&amp;nbsp; Or is there one Diogenes?&amp;nbsp; Was there, rather?&amp;nbsp; Could it be this paladin of freedom - Roger Baldwin?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well.&amp;nbsp; If you scroll down to the bottom of that Wikipedia page, you&#39;ll see a couple of interesting links.&amp;nbsp; As a sort of spoiler, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www2.law.ucla.edu/volokh/blog/baldwin.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here is one&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; This whetted my appetite - but I wanted more.&amp;nbsp; I couldn&#39;t think of a better way to demonstrate the profound and utter phoniness, the shameless and thoroughly criminal hypocrisy, of the American obsession with &quot;civil liberties,&quot; than to visit my friendly local library and request a copy of &lt;i&gt;Liberty Under the Soviets&lt;/i&gt; (1927).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy to quote at length from this work.&amp;nbsp; I feel that no inoculation is too strong against this particular variant of concern trolling.&amp;nbsp; And besides, everything should be judged by its best work.&amp;nbsp; As you&#39;ll see, the progressive thought of Roger Baldwin is remarkably compelling, well-written, thoroughly researched (thanks to an extensive Russian tour, from which I doubt sevruga was absent), and would strike any innocent reader as judicious and profoundly wise.&amp;nbsp; Here we go - excerpting liberally, starting from the very start of the book:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;A few years ago two American workers who went to join the Kuzbas colony in Siberia wrote me their impressions and feelings about Soviet Russia.&amp;nbsp; They wrote on the same day at the same table -- and yet the letters might have come from two different continents, so oppositely did they view the Russian scene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One said he never worked anywhere under better conditions.&amp;nbsp; &quot;A country in which the workers are nearer free than anywhere on earth.&quot;&amp;nbsp; The other said he never lived under such a regime of graft and espionage.&amp;nbsp; &quot;If you could see how the peasants and workers really feel about it, you would know it keeps power only by force.&quot;&amp;nbsp; Both men had gone to Russia pro-Soviet, but their temperaments led them to see and emphasize wholly different aspects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personal reactions color most of what is written about Soviet Russia.&amp;nbsp; Where one puts one&#39;s emphasis is a matter of feeling and opinion.&amp;nbsp; Anyone who writes of Russia owes it at the start to confess his personal bias; and on Russia everyone has a bias, conscious or not.&amp;nbsp; Life under the Soviets is so packed with contrasts and contradictions, that anyone can prove almost any case his bias dictates -- and prove a case against them, if he likes, out of the mouths of the Bolsheviks themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The central difficulty in any fair treatment of the Soviet experiment is to get and convey a rounded view of all the facts, showing which are temporary and incidental, and which are main tendencies and principles.&amp;nbsp; Above all, anyone trying to understand Russia must bear in mind the human and historical background on which the Communists are tackling the colossal problem of reorganizing life in revolutionary terms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On no subject is it more difficult to convey a fair view than on the issues of liberty and repression, because the viewpoints and facts are both so contradictory.&amp;nbsp; Communists everywhere see Soviet Russia as the greatest hope for the freedom of the masses.&amp;nbsp; Their opponents see it as just another iron dictatorship of a small, ruling bureaucracy, disciplining and regimenting life in the pattern of a fanatical Marxism.&amp;nbsp; The objective truth, which must appraise both views, is hard to get in focus even with agreed facts.&amp;nbsp; And even the facts are hard to state fairly, as witness the violent disagreement on them between the Communist majority and the Trotsky Opposition.&amp;nbsp; The difficulty is not so much that facts are disputed, as that they are so diverse you can take your pick to suit your contentions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My own prejudices are amply conveyed by the title of this book.&amp;nbsp; Though over half of it is devoted to a description of the controls by the Soviet state, I have chosen to call it &lt;i&gt;Liberty Under the Soviets&lt;/i&gt; because I see as far more significant the basic economic freedoms of workers and peasants and the abolition of privileged classes based on wealth; and only less important, the release of the non-Russian minorities to develop their national cultures, the new freedom of women, the revolution in education -- and, if one counts it as significant, liberty for religion -- and anti-religion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Against all these liberties stand the facts of universal censorship of all means of communication and the complete suppression of any organized opposition to the dictatorship or its program.&amp;nbsp; No civil liberty as we understand it in the West exists in Russia for opponents of the regime -- no organized freedom of speech or assemblage, or of the press.&amp;nbsp; No political liberty is permitted.&amp;nbsp; The Communist Party enjoys an exclusive monopoly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless I emphasize by title and the arrangement of this book the outstanding relation, as I see it, between the dictatorship&#39;s controls and the new liberties.&amp;nbsp; For although I am an advocate of unrestricted civil liberty as a means to effecting even revolutionary changes in society with a minimum of violence, I know that such liberty is always dependent on the possession of economic power.&amp;nbsp; Economic liberty underlies all others.&amp;nbsp; In any society civil liberties are freely exercised only by classes with economic power -- or if by other classes, only at times when the controlling class is too secure to fear opposition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Soviet Russia, despite the rigid controls and suppression of opposition, the regime is dominated by the economic needs of workers and peasants.&amp;nbsp; Their economic power, even when unorganized, is the force behind it.&amp;nbsp; Their liberties won by the Revolution are the ultimate dictators of Soviet policy.&amp;nbsp; In this lies the chief justification for the hope that, with the increasing share by the masses in all activities of life, the rigors of centralized dictatorship will be lessened and the creative forces given free rein.&amp;nbsp; Peasants and workers are keenly aware of their new liberties won by the Revolution.&amp;nbsp; Anywhere you can hear voiced their belief that, whatever their criticism and discontent, that they are &quot;free.&quot;&amp;nbsp; And they constitute over ninety percent of the Russian people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Such an attitude as I express toward the relation of economic to civil liberty may easily be construed as condoning in Russia repressions which I condemn in capitalist countries.&amp;nbsp; It is true that I feel differently about them, because I regard them as unlike.&amp;nbsp; Repressions in western democracies are weapons of struggle in a transition period to socialism.&amp;nbsp; The society the Communists seek to create will be freed of class struggle -- if achieved -- and therefore of repression. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Liberty in Russia cannot be fairly examined, as is usually attempted, on the basis of western ideas of bourgeois &quot;rights,&quot; of Socialist Party conceptions of parliamentary democracy as the chief instrumentality for achieving socialism, or of the anarchist program for the immediate revolutionary abolition of the state and the free cooperation of workers and peasants.&amp;nbsp; It must be examined primarily in the light of what Communists are attempting to do to create a society in which liberty will be a reality when economic class conflict is abolished.&amp;nbsp; Only through that process, according to the Communist view of progress, will liberty and democracy come to mean something other than the freedom of the propertied classes.&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;What are these economic liberties?&amp;nbsp; For the peasants -- eighty percent of the people -- they are primarily the right to the land they use, the control of its allotment, freedom from landlords, the right to buy and sell goods freely -- and the power to run their village business with little or no outside interference.&amp;nbsp; Those liberties, bourgeois in the sense of recognizing private property, are the foundation of peasant life, for which they would defend the Soviet regime against foreign attack or counter-revolution.&amp;nbsp; Bolshevik politics, Communist propaganda, the long-range schemes for building socialism, mean little to them.&amp;nbsp; But the regime&#39;s encouragement of cooperatives, of machine farming, of the poorer peasants against the well-to-do, of improved agriculture, of education, of recreation, mean a new life, to which the villages, for centuries static under the old regime, are slowly responding as the new generation grows up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one who has seen the new life in Russian villages can doubt the feeling of liberty, of released effort and of hope which marks the active peasants -- save for the ambitious well-to-do class (the &lt;i&gt;Kulaks&lt;/i&gt;) who resist the new order because it restricts their freedom to hire labor and rent land.&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;In practice Soviet democracy is obviously far short of a real democracy, that is, one in which all political functions are controlled by a majority of the persons participating in them.&amp;nbsp; But such a democracy has rarely existed anywhere.&amp;nbsp; That conception, however, offers a fair test by which to determine the democratic features of any system.&amp;nbsp; Tested by it, the Soviet system clearly represents the interests of the overwhelming majority of the population -- the workers and peasants -- as opposed to propertied classes, and they alone participate in such democracy as the dictatorship permits.&amp;nbsp; The trading class, richer peasants (Kulaks) and former czarist officials are alone disenfranchised.&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;The question is often raised as to whether or not Party members occupy a privileged position in Russia as compared with ordinary citizens.&amp;nbsp; The answer to that must recognize first the fact that Party membership carries responsibilities far greater than those of an ordinary citizen.&amp;nbsp; A member&#39;s life is controlled by the Party.&amp;nbsp; His job, salary, outside activities, are all subject to orders like a soldier in an army.&amp;nbsp; Members can be counted on for service as outsiders cannot.&amp;nbsp; So they naturally get jobs when others are out of work, and they get better public jobs, sometimes by more competence, sometimes by political pull.&amp;nbsp; But their salaries are limited to a maximum below that of many public employees, though their general salary level is higher than the average wage-workers.&amp;nbsp; In certain public offices they may get some privileges through Party connections -- such as cheaper and better lodgings, occasional use of the departmental automobiles, and sometimes wholesale rates on purchases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the picture so often painted of a ruling political class above and over the people of Russia, enjoying the privileges of greater wealth and position, is pure invention, originating probably in a comparatively few exceptions, some of them, it is true, flagrant enough to arouse public scandal.&amp;nbsp; But the Party is severe on all those who seek personal privilege in goods or position out of office or Party membership.&amp;nbsp; The Party continually cleanses its membership by expulsion, getting rid of those who are not devoted, or who try to use the Party for their private interests, or whose &quot;ideology&quot; is not Communist.&amp;nbsp; The Communist Party is hard to get into and easy to get out of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scores of Communists I met all over Russia, from secretaries in the small towns and villages to the heads of departments in Moscow, struck me with few exceptions as extraordinarily able and astute men -- on the whole abler, more alert and more devoted than any official class I ever met.&amp;nbsp; This youth, enthusiasm and faith in what they are doing stand out in marked contrast to the routineers so common in most government service.&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;Anyone who travels in Russia must be impressed at once with the extraordinary diversity of the peoples of the Soviet Union, and with the intensity of national feeling among the non-Russians.&amp;nbsp; And if you dig under the surface to the policies of the regime you are struck at once by a newly released freedom of their cultures so striking that it bulks large among the achievements of the Revolution.&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;Racial prejudice or discrimination of any sort on account of race is fought by law and propaganda.&amp;nbsp; The Constitution &quot;declares it contrary to the fundamental laws... to institute or tolerate privileges... founded on such grounds, or to repress national minorities, or in any way to limit their rights.&quot;&amp;nbsp; The criminal code severely penalizes stirring up religious or racial strife.&amp;nbsp; Freedom from race prejudice is probably greater in Russia than in any country of mixed population in the world.&amp;nbsp; It is imbedded in the Communist political philosophy, and it is expressed practically in their political institutions.&amp;nbsp; The constant effort is to aid the poorest and most disadvantaged classes, who, in mixed populations, have historically been the victims of race prejudice.&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;The Communist philosophy is vigorously anti-religious, based on a materialistic, scientific conception of life opposed to mysticism and theology.&amp;nbsp; Though there is now no state church, there is an anti-church state.&amp;nbsp; The weight of official influence is and has been continuously against the church as an institution and against religion as a force opposed to the Communist conception of scientific social progress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To understand the significance of that attitude in Russia, one must bear in mind the primitive superstitions of the peasant masses, the priests&#39; support of landlords and police, and the still childlike belief of the peasants in miracles and rites to bring them good fortune and good crops.&amp;nbsp; The Soviet anti-religious attitude in practice is primarily a crusade to abolish peasant superstition by education in science and by practical demonstrations of the power of scientific farming as against prayer.&amp;nbsp; In a time of drought, for instance, when the priests head a procession into the fields carrying ikons to bring rain, the Communists will put up posters showing dry-farming methods and the wisdom of deeper ploughing to save the grain.&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;To help diminish the power of religion, children under eighteen years of age are prohibited from attending religious schools.&amp;nbsp; They may be instructed only by their parents in their own homes, and not even there in the cases of those youngsters who object to it, and who complain to the authorities, as many are said to have done.&amp;nbsp; The Mohammedans, however, as we have noted, are allowed to admit to religious schools children as young as fourteen, a concession to the Oriental peoples, whose antagonism the Soviet regime is careful not to arouse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Religious worship goes on almost unrestricted.&amp;nbsp; The churches throughout Russia are practically all in active use and well-filled -- by women more than by men, as with us.&amp;nbsp; New churches are allowed to be built, though formerly they were not.&amp;nbsp; Many were taken over in the early days for sport clubs and theatres but that caused so much resentment that it was stopped.&amp;nbsp; Only in Tiflis, Georgia, where the cathedral on the main street was turned into an athletic club, did I hear resentment still bitterly expressed.&amp;nbsp; But Georgia is generally resentful of the regime.&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;Everywhere I went in Russian prisons I found long-haired, long-bearded priests still wearing their robes -- some in for common crimes, most for political offenses dating chiefly from the time of the seizures of church treasures.&amp;nbsp; In the detention prison in Leningrad, where I asked to be shown the cell which Lenin occupied for a while in 1896, the door opened on a startling sight -- a patriarchal archbishop in the yellow silk robes of his office.&amp;nbsp; He informed me in fluent French that he was &quot;quite loyal to the Soviet regime,&quot; but was held, he knew not for what, on account of the government&#39;s hostility to the church.&amp;nbsp; For good measure -- for the prison was crowded -- he shared the historic cell with a Finnish spy and a speculator.&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;To sum up, it is evident that religious liberty under the Soviets is vastly greater than it was under the czar, despite the fact that the czar was for religion and the Soviets are against it.&amp;nbsp; Freedom for anti-religion is naturally much greater than anywhere else in the world, since it is officially encouraged and directed as part of the Communist program -- although it is still a weak force except as it opposes scientific agriculture to peasant superstition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sectarians, evangelicals, and the non-Christian religions enjoy about as much freedom as in other countries, and more than in most with a state church.&amp;nbsp; The old Orthodox and Roman Catholic churches alone suffered severe restrictions, primarily due to their anti-Soviet activity.&amp;nbsp; Such restrictions on general religious activity as exist, are not aimed at religious freedom.&amp;nbsp; They are the restrictions common to the licensing of all private organizations and the censorship of all journals and books in the interest of promoting the Communist program.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, the State is freer of religious influence than in any other country in the world -- which is something to be said even in comparison with the United States, where the legal separation of church and state does not prevent the interference of sectarian interests in education -- for instance through the prohibition of teaching evolution and through the compulsory reading of the Protestant Bible in public schools, to say nothing of the power of religious prejudice in elections.&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;The control of foreign correspondents in two ways: first, through their admission to Russia; and second, through examination of their wire dispatches.&amp;nbsp; Dispatches by mail are not examined, and can be checked up only by reading the foreign press.&amp;nbsp; Control over the admission of correspondents is rigid.&amp;nbsp; Correspondents of hostile papers are not admitted, nor are hostile correspondents of papers whose fair representatives might be admitted.&amp;nbsp; A hostile paper is one which is regarded as systematically misrepresenting conditions in Soviet Russia.&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;The Foreign Office keeps close watch on correspondents through reading the foreign press.&amp;nbsp; It also sizes up their point of view.&amp;nbsp; One type of correspondent, of whom there have been a number in Moscow, is the man who &quot;lies by telling the truth.&quot;&amp;nbsp; He selects from the Russian press for his dispatches all the damaging articles he can find, omitting anything favorable to the Soviet regime.&amp;nbsp; The censor cannot call him to account for inaccuracy, but he is warned that if his paper&#39;s policy is to print only damaging news his leave to stay will not be renewed.&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;What are the liberties of the press under the Soviets?&amp;nbsp; From a western, bourgeois point of view there are, of course, none.&amp;nbsp; But&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;The GPU is an exceedingly efficient organization, probably the best organized political police department in the world, and therefore the most effective in discovering and arresting the offenders under its jurisdiction.&amp;nbsp; It has the advantage of adding to the already highly developed system of the czar&#39;s Okhrana the knowledge of underground tactics gained by the Bolsheviks in the years when they were an illegal conspiracy.&amp;nbsp; Many of the technical methods of the Okhrana, together with some of its old specialists, have been taken over and incorporated into the new system, which has larger powers and a greater personnel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The G.P.U. is the successor to the Tcheka (the Extraordinary Revolutionary Commission), formed to fight the counter-revolution which developed shortly after the Bolshevik seizure of power, and abolished by decree early in 1922 after the civil wars and foreign intervention were over.&amp;nbsp; The Tcheka was the agency of the &quot;Red Terror,&quot; with unrestricted powers of arrest, imprisonment, and execution.&amp;nbsp; The G.P.U., established in its place, taking over its machinery, buildings, and prisons, was restricted, first, by having the legality of all its orders of exile and imprisonment subjected to the review and joint control of a special Attorney-General, and second, by taking away the power of summary execution and requiring approval in advance by the Central Executive Committee.&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;Reports of conditions in G.P.U. temporary prisons, where prisoners are isolated from all outside contact, often in solitary cells, subject to grilling inquiry -- frequently in the middle of the night -- and worse, to uncertainty as to their fate, also heighten fear.&amp;nbsp; Reports of brutality by the G.P.U., particularly of beating and third degree methods, are current, but the evidence to sustain them seems mostly to date back to the days of the Tcheka.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have talked with many ex-prisoners in Russia and abroad, and have read also all the published accounts of the prison experiences of others, and from all of them I gathered that police brutality such as we know it in America is rare in Russia.&amp;nbsp; Long-continued grillings, isolation, and wretched physical conditions are the worst of the evils of preliminary detentions.&amp;nbsp; Only in Tiflis did I hear, from what seemed credible sources, of beatings to extort information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One G.P.U. practice, frequently noted because so public, lends color to charges of brutality: the transfer of groups of prisoners on foot through the streets under soldier guard with fixed bayonets.&amp;nbsp; To Americans it should be said that this brutality appears to be insignificant compared with the routine cruelties of the third degree practised daily by every sizeable police department in the United States.&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;To sum up, the whole system of dealing with political opposition in Russia rests on extraordinarily broad foundations - broader than elsewhere in the world.&amp;nbsp; It rests first on the loose and inclusive legal definition of political offenses, and second on the extraordinary powers of the G.P.U. in arrests, prosecution, &quot;trial,&quot; imprisonment, and exile.&amp;nbsp; Both the conception of political crime and the discretion of the political police are wider either than under the czar, or than in other countries.&amp;nbsp; They are analogous to other countries in a state of war, which is how Soviet Russia regards herself.&amp;nbsp; But there is no such atmosphere in Russia, the system working almost invisibly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given the conditions out of which this stern discipline of the country grew, together with the inherited habits of government and the continuous struggle against enemies abroad and within, its excesses are understandable.&amp;nbsp; They yield to a far more natural explanation than the romantic interpretation of &quot;Asiatic cruelty&quot; often attached to them.&amp;nbsp; Moralizing about the G.P.U.&amp;nbsp; system does not explain it.&amp;nbsp; Its function in relationship to the dictatorship does.&amp;nbsp; It occupies the place of the Communist Party&#39;s immediate weapon of defense -- swift, decisive, final.&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;To avoid errors in quoting official policies, the entire first draft of this book was very kindly read by a Soviet official qualified to give exact information.&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;/blockquote&gt;Given this historical context, joining with Roger Baldwin in singing the praises of &quot;civil liberties&quot; is the rough moral equivalent of joining with Alfred Rosenberg in a celebration of the &lt;i&gt;Deutsche Volk&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Germans, we can agree, are good people.&amp;nbsp; Nonetheless, if I want to say that Germans are good people, I will go out of my way ten times to avoid saying it in the same words as Alfred Rosenberg. Let alone through the &lt;i&gt;same institutions&lt;/i&gt; as Alfred Rosenberg.&amp;nbsp; Did you ever give money to the ACLU?&amp;nbsp; Even $10?&amp;nbsp; Feeling dirty yet?&amp;nbsp; Hey, didn&#39;t you love that reference to the nasty old Kulaks?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And worse still, the ACLU (even if, to be perfectly frank, it did originate as the legal defense organ of the CPUSA) is not and was never a pseudopod of the Soviet Union.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s older than the Soviet Union.&amp;nbsp; It is a quintessentially American institution in every way, shape and form - right down to its impeccably WASP founder, who no one could possibly mistake for some greasy, funny-talking little Jew.&amp;nbsp; Its guilt is not &lt;i&gt;their&lt;/i&gt; guilt.&amp;nbsp; Its guilt is &lt;i&gt;our&lt;/i&gt; guilt - and democracy&#39;s guilt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suppose Professor Solove is right, and privacy and democracy go hand in hand.&amp;nbsp; To defend privacy is to defend democracy.&amp;nbsp; To defend the guilty, of course, is to double down.&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s been a lot of doubling down - a kind of moral martingale.&amp;nbsp; When I think of the martingale, I always think of Wile E. Coyote, who is perfectly fine running off the edge of the cliff until he looks down.&amp;nbsp; Don&#39;t look down.&amp;nbsp; Your whole country, your whole century, your whole &lt;i&gt;planet&lt;/i&gt;, might be morally bankrupt.&amp;nbsp; And when operating in bankruptcy, the most important thing is to avoid doing the books.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s not just that the Commucaust was ten times bigger than the Holocaust.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s that &lt;i&gt;both&lt;/i&gt; are best understood as epiphenomena of the democratic era.&amp;nbsp; Which isn&#39;t over yet!&amp;nbsp; At least not when we classify pseudo-democracies among the consequences of democracy.&amp;nbsp; And why wouldn&#39;t we?&amp;nbsp; Hitler&#39;s Berlin, FDR&#39;s Washington, and Stalin&#39;s Moscow are each pretending, each in its own way, to be a &quot;genuine democracy.&quot;&amp;nbsp; Without the ideal, how could we have the pretense?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of these three ruthless regimes, the crimes of the first are rigorously investigated and permanently famous; those of the last have been sporadically looked into, a little; and our own in the middle, emerging victorious, remains well cloaked in the usual golden froth of a hagiographic personality cult with a locked archive.&amp;nbsp; Indeed, until the American, British and Soviet archives are fully opened and the inevitable gaps charted, no intelligence-quality history of the 20th century can be written - which means no history worth reading, and certainly none worth believing in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, don&#39;t believe!&amp;nbsp; You can stop any time, really.&amp;nbsp; Hey, man, it&#39;s a new century.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_law_of_oligarchy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;reality&lt;/a&gt; of political history is that all polities of nontrivial size are controlled by organized minorities, all nontrivial democracies are pseudo-democracies.&amp;nbsp; They are all different, however, since every organized minority is different.&amp;nbsp; Every government flavored with democracy is irredeemably foul, but broadly the 20th-century pseudo-democratic regimes can be separated into two broad categories: oligarchical (communist, impersonal) and despotic (fascist, personal).&amp;nbsp; Your preference depends on whether you prefer to be ruled by an omnipotent politician or a faceless machine.&amp;nbsp; There is no difficulty in classifying the USG, or any other major modern government - they are all oligarchies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So are we truly guilty?&amp;nbsp; Perhaps this is an out - it is not us, but our rulers, who have committed these terrible collaborations.&amp;nbsp; And by them conquered, of course, the world.&amp;nbsp; Leading inexorably to our present national position of &quot;global leadership,&quot; not at all to be confused with &quot;world domination.&quot; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The question of whether the voting community is an active participant, or a passive part, in this machine, is an empirical one.&amp;nbsp; It is of course much easier for the community to be an active participant in a fascist regime where individual politicians take actual power as a consequence of their personal support - although once they attain that power, they can build the usual apparatus to &quot;manufacture consent.&quot;&amp;nbsp; Thus in a sense fascism is the more democratic form, but only in a sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In an oligarchical regime, public opinion is always an effect rather than a cause.&amp;nbsp; It still matters, but only in the sense that some effects cannot be caused.&amp;nbsp; But the power of the machine is always increasing.&amp;nbsp; Few in the Reagan era could have imagined that in the lives of their grown children, most Americans would come to regard gay marriage as an essential civil right.&amp;nbsp; Why did this happen?&amp;nbsp; Because the ruling class is sovereign not just politically, but also intellectually.&amp;nbsp; What it believes, everyone comes to believe - and is horrified that previous generations somehow failed to believe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Through the 20C America was always the leading communist power, but no form is pure.&amp;nbsp; All these regimes are exquisitely vile and they have no hesitation in sharing syringes.&amp;nbsp; The USSR, of course, was run by a Party organized on ultra-fascist despotic lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And by our good communist standards of the early 21C, early 20C America - Roger Baldwin&#39;s America, no less - looks fascist in many ways.&amp;nbsp; Racism, nativism, classism and just plain domination are everywhere in sight.&amp;nbsp; Unimaginable sexual prudery is universal, with many perfectly comely young women not learning proper fellatio technique until high school or even college.&amp;nbsp; And worst of all, as late as Teddy Roosevelt, elected politicians actually seem to be in control of the government.&amp;nbsp; (Someone should assemble a &quot;Hitler, Mussolini or TR&quot; quote-matching test.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On very generous days, we might admit that politicians retained significant authority over the USG as late as the 1950s.&amp;nbsp; This was when a certain Senator from North Hicksville decided to look into the matter of why a billion foreigners were condemned to total slavery and thirty million to actual death, not even for any apparent national purpose, but apparently just to get the dicks of a few hundred Georgetown civil servants hard or at least maintain them in that accustomed condition. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the esteemed Senator asked for the State Department&#39;s super sekrit private files.&amp;nbsp; State, never a stranger to hardball, told him to go take a flying fuck at a plate-glass window.&amp;nbsp; The Senate, an elected institution, with massive support from the American People, up against a mere executive agency with no constitutional power.&amp;nbsp; Total bureaucratic chimpanzee war!&amp;nbsp; Or so you&#39;d think.&amp;nbsp; In fact, a last gasp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was State defunded?&amp;nbsp; Erased from God&#39;s bureaucratic earth by fire - like Hamburg or Tokyo, let&#39;s not forget, ten years earlier? &amp;nbsp; Roasted in the depths of a giant Sloar?&amp;nbsp; State, of course, prospered.&amp;nbsp; State prospers to this day.&amp;nbsp; Despite the bloody scraps of Syria between its teeth.&amp;nbsp; Despite?&amp;nbsp; Or because of? Hey, everybody&#39;s got to eat.&amp;nbsp; Democracy is messy, I can tell you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Senator was shunned by his colleagues.&amp;nbsp; He and his friends were exiled from public life and became, over the next five decades, a metonym for paranoid criminal insanity of the political type. &amp;nbsp; The American People approved!&amp;nbsp; They changed their minds!&amp;nbsp; They saw the Senator on TV and decided he looked like a big meanie.&amp;nbsp; He couldn&#39;t even shave properly!&amp;nbsp; He missed a spot!&amp;nbsp; A fickle People.&amp;nbsp; Perhaps next month they would have changed their minds right back.&amp;nbsp; But really, why give them the chance?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Constitution is great, but Nature has laws as well.&amp;nbsp; One is that the fickle are generally not left in charge of armies, battleships or nuclear weapons.&amp;nbsp; If the Constitution declares that the fickle shall rule, too bad for the Constitution.&amp;nbsp; By contradicting Nature, the Constitution has contradicted itself.&amp;nbsp; And it shall not rule.&amp;nbsp; And that, dear Americans, is when you finally settled in under your new communist oligarchy.&amp;nbsp; Whether you knew it or not.&amp;nbsp; Not, mostly - but that&#39;s what it is to be a chump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nature&#39;s inflexible law is that if you want to hold power, you need to be competent to retain it.&amp;nbsp; Otherwise, it is no use getting power.&amp;nbsp; It will be taken away from you, for good and ill, by someone capable of defeating you.&amp;nbsp; And the only thing more ignominious and pathetic than being defeated in the eternal contest for power, is being so owned and &lt;i&gt;not even knowing it&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alas, dear Americans - &quot;progressives,&quot; ie, communists, and &quot;constitutionalists,&quot; ie, fascists - the both of you, this is your pathetic condition.&amp;nbsp; And you&#39;re worried that someone is grepping your emails?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this last epic battle between the Congress and the Executive, your country, not to mention its gloriously liberated &quot;allies,&quot; ie, captured satellite states, has been run (with spasmodic, unserious, temporary attempts at resistance, but not reversal) by its permanent civil service.&amp;nbsp; This is what &quot;democracy&quot; means to you: government by permanent civil servants.&amp;nbsp; As for your elected officials, you could dismiss them all tomorrow, and not elect more, and your experience of government would not change in the slightest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bureaucratic oligarchy is a common historical form in large old states.&amp;nbsp; Regardless of formal status, a &quot;permanent civil servant&quot; is anyone who sets government policy, is funded by the government, or has privileged access to government secrets, and who cannot be fired by any practical executive action.&amp;nbsp; This definition includes essentially all professors and journalists - and &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; legitimate and/or respected professors and journalists.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s really quite sustainable.&amp;nbsp; For instance, for the last two millennia it&#39;s been the normal condition of Chinese government.&amp;nbsp; It is unusual to have a figurehead People instead of a figurehead King, Pharaoh Emperor.&amp;nbsp; But since neither matters, the difference doesn&#39;t matter much, now, does it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And this is how you come to live in a world where there are these two separate concepts, &quot;politics&quot; and &quot;democracy,&quot; with opposite emotional valence.&amp;nbsp; Calling anything &quot;political&quot; is a harsh condemnation.&amp;nbsp; But if it is &quot;democratic,&quot; it is good and sweet and true.&amp;nbsp; But what is democracy without politics?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing more than the American system of government - communism, ie, rule by the party of civil service.&amp;nbsp; As Americans, we can at least be thankful that communism has done less damage here than elsewhere.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s great to be an exporter, especially when your product is dioxin.&amp;nbsp; It gives you the comforts you need to worry that someone is grepping your emails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thus, while I am not really one for purges, I&#39;d be dismayed to see anyone who calls himself a real reactionary worrying at all that &lt;a href=&quot;http://obamaischeckingyouremail.tumblr.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Obama is reading his email&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Or whatever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, a reactionary is a gentleman (or a lady).&amp;nbsp; A gentleman (or a lady) doesn&#39;t whine.&amp;nbsp; If he finds himself whining, it will be because his leg has been crushed by a truck and he&#39;s in enormous fucking pain.&amp;nbsp; It won&#39;t be because some meanie is denying him his universal human right to rule the country, or his 1/10^8 share in that right, or whatever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My son actually thinks he has human rights.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s because he&#39;s 2.&amp;nbsp; This morning he asserted his right not to take his amoxicillin - with some success, but not much.&amp;nbsp; I expect the critics of the NSA to have about the same luck.&amp;nbsp; When I became a man, I put aside childish things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a man or for a community of men, the right to rule is a function of the might to rule.&amp;nbsp; If the sound competent Midwest can get itself euchred out of its democratic right to rule by a bunch of slick Harvard men, the sound competent Midwest cannot maintain its authority and will get euchred by someone someday.&amp;nbsp; If it&#39;s not Harvard today it&#39;ll be Yale tomorrow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for your right to &quot;privacy,&quot; as if having your emails grepped affected you in any way, it is by accident.&amp;nbsp; Forget about the opponents of the government being persecuted.&amp;nbsp; If they are persecuted, which is not their decision of course, (a) it will not be by means of grep, and (b) they&#39;ll have to learn to deal with it, like men, rather than whining like little girls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously, almost all of those complaining are complaining because they are better communists than the Obama administration.&amp;nbsp; A remarkable achievement, though it owes more to the complainees.&amp;nbsp; Power does season a man - maybe only Nixon could go to China, but only Eric Holder could crack down on the Associated Press.&amp;nbsp; (Hey guys - I know you&#39;re big fans - don&#39;t you like the way that red lightsaber feels in your hand?&amp;nbsp; Swing it around a little.&amp;nbsp; Well-balanced, isn&#39;t it?&amp;nbsp; Nice test cut you&#39;ve taken - maybe it&#39;s time for some real rail-splitting? Take it home, use it for a week, bring it back if you don&#39;t like it?&amp;nbsp; You&#39;ll really enjoy working out with this little baby, I can tell you.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But unfortunately, America is a communist country and Americans are not persecuted for being too communist.&amp;nbsp; Au contraire - they are petted and lionized.&amp;nbsp; They appear daring while taking no risks. &amp;nbsp; It&#39;s perfect.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s true that there were a couple of periods where as many as ten or twelve communists suffered mild professional consequences for cavorting too openly with the Soviet mass-murder cult.&amp;nbsp; Surely ten Americans a day are fired for racism.&amp;nbsp; Hitler has been dead for 70 years, and the Brown Scare rolls on - at a thousand times the maximum intensity of &quot;McCarthyism&quot; or the Palmer Raids. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you&#39;re a good communist, you have only &lt;i&gt;symbolic&lt;/i&gt; worries about your privacy.&amp;nbsp; These worries are simply a projection of your political penis envy.&amp;nbsp; You react the same way to having your emails grepped as if someone said you weren&#39;t allowed to vote in 2016.&amp;nbsp; In reality, this loss would not affect you at all.&amp;nbsp; &lt;i&gt;Symbolically&lt;/i&gt;, however, it would represent a profound Freudian castration.&amp;nbsp; In fact, if you fail to express your symbolic political masculinity, preferably through a Facebook update, you will feel castrated by default.&amp;nbsp; But gross public outrage restores your hypothetical testosterone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whereas out here on the &quot;extreme right,&quot; some of us &lt;i&gt;actually do&lt;/i&gt; oppose the government.&amp;nbsp; I would be genuinely worried if I thought Washington was capable of persecuting dissident intellectuals.&amp;nbsp; One way to see where America is going is to look at where its satellites in Europe are, and Britain and other countries certainly treat jokes on the train and casual anti-Party tweets much the same way the Czech authorities in 1971 or the German authorities in 1937 treated unconstructive public comments about the Party or the Leader.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But really, these fools are easy targets.&amp;nbsp; Yo, don&#39;t be an easy target.&amp;nbsp; Don&#39;t blow shit up and don&#39;t try to found any tax-exempt organizations, and you ought to be fine.&amp;nbsp; The Cheka ain&#39;t in the building.&amp;nbsp; And the process of turning our progressive bureaucrats into Chekisty would not involve making them more awful, but more energetic, manly and capable.&amp;nbsp; I won&#39;t hold my breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is obvious to those of us who actually have a reason to consider the government a genuine threat, that these surveillance mechanisms are not a genuine threat.&amp;nbsp; Rather, they are designed, probably not very well, to do the job they are supposedly doing, which is a hard job and really can&#39;t be done well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A prudently governed nation would not need to record everyone&#39;s phone calls and emails.&amp;nbsp; A prudently governed nation would concern itself with its own affairs and no one else&#39;s.&amp;nbsp; It would thus maintain either a culturally and politically homogeneous state in which terrorism was no more a concern than in the conflict between Vermont and New Hampshire, or a polycultural regime like the Ottoman one, in which every culture governs itself and knows it will suffer, not advance, if its members go crazy.&amp;nbsp; But apparently the Orwellian panopticon creates more jobs in Virginia than the boring alternative of fencing the borders and enforcing consular law, so we can expect it to thrive.&amp;nbsp; Americans prefer this ridiculous regime to any other.&amp;nbsp; Yet they still object to being blown up indiscriminately in public places as if they were Israelis enduring the &quot;peace process.&quot;&amp;nbsp; So there is really no alternative, especially as our impending defeat in Afghanistan will swell the jihadi supply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moreover, the fascist militarists who actually do this job are some of the best men in America.&amp;nbsp; American communism, for obvious reasons, loves to send America&#39;s best men to Afghanistan to get their private parts Osterized by fertilizer bombs.&amp;nbsp; This is American war since 1945: State solving the problem of how it can get DoD to stick its dick in a blender.&amp;nbsp; Solving it rather well, I&#39;d say.&amp;nbsp; Many of America&#39;s best men are in the Pentagon, and good men know how to obey, and into the blender goes that dick.&amp;nbsp; Still, much testicle remains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All this said, no nation is or ever has been perfect.&amp;nbsp; All have committed terrible crimes.&amp;nbsp; All men, of course, are sinners.&amp;nbsp; America is a communist country, the whole world is America, and communism is a religion of pure hate and murder with 100 million corpses on its conscience.&amp;nbsp; Still it continues.&amp;nbsp; Many, even most, &quot;progressives&quot; are perfectly nice people.&amp;nbsp; Libertarians, such as Edward Snowden (whose girlfriend, sadly, will have no alternative but to seek tingles in the arms of Roissy), are often even better.&amp;nbsp; I used to be a libertarian myself.&amp;nbsp; I didn&#39;t realize my brain was doing the nasty with Roger Baldwin.&amp;nbsp; Snowden himself seems like a nice guy, and future pressure-cooker bomb victims can only wish he&#39;d found UR in time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sometimes think about how the Third Reich of 2013 would rationalize the Holocaust if somehow, in 1945, one of Hitler&#39;s wonder weapons had actually turned the tide.&amp;nbsp; The Holocaust, of course, was a war crime - the peacetime Reich never could have committed such a deed.&amp;nbsp; Perhaps it could have only been committed by a Reich that knew it was losing the war.&amp;nbsp; Perhaps we were lucky enough not to see what atrocities democracy would have committed, had it been about to lose its war - we certainly committed enough in the winning.&amp;nbsp; But be that as it may.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would this victorious Germany, in the lives of its grandchildren, feel any sense of national guilt?&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s easy to feel guilt on behalf of the Other - this is not guilt, but condemnation.&amp;nbsp; The Germany of 2013 has conveniently converted its grandparents into an Other, and so can feel guilty on their behalf.&amp;nbsp; Naturally it feels no guilt at all for the crimes of democracy, its actual present ideology.&amp;nbsp; But be that as it may.&amp;nbsp; What about the question?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the answer is no.&amp;nbsp; First of all, though everything I know about Hitler tells me he ordered the Holocaust, this is just my personal judgment.&amp;nbsp; There is no actual evidence either way.&amp;nbsp; So the crime, though it could not possibly have been concealed from history, would be ascribed not to National Socialism, not even to Hitler, but rather to Himmler.&amp;nbsp; Similarly, American historians overlook the obvious fact that Alger Hiss could have done nothing without FDR&#39;s personal permission, and mistake the Hiss-Hopkins backchannel to the KGB for a case of &quot;espionage&quot; - not even considering the idea that FDR, the New Deal, or America as a whole could be seen as generally guilty for our collaboration, concealment, and general complicity with Stalin&#39;s enormous crimes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never underestimate the power of &quot;no true Scotsman.&quot;&amp;nbsp; I once enraged the husband of my cousin, a devout Obama voter who grew up in the Soviet Union, by asking him what the Russian translation of &quot;progressive&quot; was.&amp;nbsp; Of course he knew perfectly well that the Soviet ogre had uttered this word continuously from 1917 to 1989.&amp;nbsp; Indeed, &quot;progressive&quot; has been exclusively a euphemism for &quot;communist,&quot; on both sides of the Atlantic, since the mid-30s or so.&amp;nbsp; And yet, his response would be: Stalin was not a true progressive, but a demon pretending to be a true progressive.&amp;nbsp; In fact, this is the standard position of today&#39;s neo-communist on the USSR: fascist deviationism, not true communism.&amp;nbsp; Did the experiment fail?&amp;nbsp; Au contraire, mon frere - it has never been tried!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just so.&amp;nbsp; And so, the National Socialist of our alternate 2013 would declare: nothing could possibly be as un-German as the Holocaust.&amp;nbsp; (True.)&amp;nbsp; Since Himmler ordered the Holocaust (true), nothing could be as un-German, and therefore as un-National Socialist, as Himmler.&amp;nbsp; Himmler, therefore, stands unmasked by history&#39;s prosecution as no true Nazi.&amp;nbsp; And so forth.&amp;nbsp; In fact, it is not out of the question that even &lt;i&gt;Hitler himself&lt;/i&gt; could be condemned as no true Nazi.&amp;nbsp; If Stalin is no true communist, why not?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And life in our alternate Third Reich?&amp;nbsp; It would go on, as it does in our communist world - cheerfully unstained by any kind of genuine moral reflection.&amp;nbsp; Just as I have a genuine respect for Roissy&#39;s honest, if foul, amorality, I have an enormous contempt for sham moral outrage.&amp;nbsp; Can there be real outrage?&amp;nbsp; Absolutely.&amp;nbsp; But you cannot get from the sham directly to the reality.&amp;nbsp; You have to abandon it for pure cold cynicism, then work hard for even the smallest scrap of genuine human feeling.&amp;nbsp; Alas, it will not be as stimulating as your porn, your &quot;civil liberties&quot; and the like.&amp;nbsp; Hopefully in time you will nonetheless come to prefer it.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/feeds/1971692008061277307/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7958140996781104565&amp;postID=1971692008061277307' title='174 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7958140996781104565/posts/default/1971692008061277307'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7958140996781104565/posts/default/1971692008061277307'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2013/06/civil-liberties-and-single-reactionary.html' title='Civil liberties and the single reactionary'/><author><name>Mencius Moldbug</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/16472157249344139282</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>174</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7958140996781104565.post-8545194039227436213</id><published>2013-04-25T10:38:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2013-04-25T10:42:42.277-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Bitcoin panic light flashing bright amber</title><content type='html'>&lt;div class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.forbes.com/sites/jonmatonis/2013/01/28/government-ban-on-bitcoin-would-fail-miserably/&quot;

Now it looks like they’re trying to squelch another disruptive, innovative payments system.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least three exchanges in the U.S. that traded the digital currency Bitcoin have shut down, apparently as a result of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fincen.gov/statutes_regs/guidance/html/FIN-2013-G001.html&quot;&gt;guidance&lt;/a&gt; issued last month by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. That agency has emerged as the top threat, at least in in the United States, to the decentralized Bitcoin network – more so than the widely reported price volatility and hacker attacks.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Matonis does not include the most telling parts of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freebanking.org/author/jansen/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bradley Jensen&lt;/a&gt; interview (my transcript).&amp;nbsp; Around 17:30:&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;Jensen: &quot;I have heard through the grapevine that FinCEN has prosecutions in the works for Bitcoin broadly speaking.  My guess, based on the timing of the guidance, and what I had heard previously from the rumor mill about the prosecutions, is that FinCEN put out the guidance sort of ex post facto to justify the prosecutions that they&#39;re about to launch.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Interviewer: &quot;So you expect this to happen within in the next couple of months...&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jensen:  &quot;Again, I&#39;ve heard different rumors, it&#39;s difficult to predict, but yeah.  We knew that the prosecutions were in the works, and then later the guidance came out, it seems like a sort of CYA approach to how they&#39;re doing it.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Around 21:30:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;Jensen: &quot;We knew that these guidelines and these prosecutions were in the works, even last Congress.  Ron Paul was the chairman of the House subcommittee that had jurisdiction over FinCEN, and he never had a single hearing on this.  Congress has dropped the ball.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Interviewer: &quot;Why is that, do you think?&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jensen: &quot;For a lot of people these are relatively obscure questions... I mean, Congress is a representative body that works to meet the demands of their constituents.  Their constituents are demanding a balanced budget or gun control or immigration reform or something else... those are the issues that you deal with.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Jensen, like &lt;a href=&quot;http://foseti.wordpress.com/2013/04/11/btcs/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Foseti&lt;/a&gt;, has lived in and knows tha USG - the real one, not the one you see on TV:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;What is the purpose of an alternative currency?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Let me answer that by analogy.  What is the purpose of the internet?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;If you’re reading this, you use the internet to read the often  unorganized thoughts of a person with strange views on all kinds of  subjects.  Undoubtedly, facilitating such reading is one function of the  internet.

In reality, however, it’s just a way for  people to break laws governing financial transactions.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;It&#39;s kind of a problem that (most of) Silicon Valley thinks it&#39;s governed by the TV Washington.&amp;nbsp;

I fear it attracts low-quality traffic.&amp;nbsp; Comments are off.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone in a meeting the other day called my theory of why Bitcoin, a useless commodity, has a nonzero price, the &quot;bubble theory of money.&quot;&amp;nbsp; I like it.&amp;nbsp; I think it could stick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first came up with this BTM (which is only a slight, &lt;i&gt;slight&lt;/i&gt; variation of &lt;a href=&quot;http://mises.org/document/4984&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Carl Menger&#39;s theory&lt;/a&gt;) and posted it &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.safehaven.com/article/5205/why-the-global-financial-system-is-about-to-collapse&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;seven years ago&lt;/a&gt;, I was genuinely concerned that the global mass mind, or at least the global financial mind, might be &lt;a href=&quot;http://terrytao.wordpress.com/2008/02/05/the-blue-eyed-islanders-puzzle/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;hyper-rational&lt;/a&gt; and converge spontaneously on the equilibrium solution, perhaps in as little as fifteen minutes.&amp;nbsp; Resulting in unbelievable global mayhem.&amp;nbsp; Which would arguably be my fault.&amp;nbsp; And for which I would certainly be blamed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously, I had a lot to learn about the global financial mind.&amp;nbsp; No one in this business has a clue.&amp;nbsp; Everyone who thinks he has a clue has no clue at all.&amp;nbsp; The rest get by with about half of one, plus a dab of good taste and a lot of hard work.&amp;nbsp; If you have money to stash away and enough to hire a pro, find some grizzled old silverback like &lt;a href=&quot;http://nihoncassandra.blogspot.com/2013/04/on-bitcoin.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Cassandra&lt;/a&gt; and let his spidey sense do the work.&amp;nbsp; He doesn&#39;t have a clue, but nor do you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For example, while the BTM is impeccable in theory, it does not tell you, me, or anyone whether Bitcoin is money or Bitcoin is a bubble.&amp;nbsp; If Bitcoin is money, Bitcoin at $150 is absurdly cheap.&amp;nbsp; Otherwise, it is hilariously expensive.&amp;nbsp; Bitcoin will go to zero or infinity - almost certainly the former.&amp;nbsp; What is the expected value?&amp;nbsp; Answer unclear - ask again later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Us feeble-brained humans are uncomfortable with &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_dependence&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;path-dependent&lt;/a&gt; outcomes.&amp;nbsp; We don&#39;t want Bitcoin, or anything, to have an arbitrary price determined merely by marginal bid and ask, let alone a multiple equilibrium - we want it to have an underlying &lt;i&gt;value&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Which is a physical property, like weight or orangeness.&amp;nbsp; When I say that Bitcoin is money &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; Bitcoin is a bubble, your mind grows nervous, as if forced to contemplate a car that is orange &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; green.&amp;nbsp; Sure, it&#39;s all waves &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; particles at the bottom - but, really.&amp;nbsp; Physics is one thing, accounting is another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The BTM asserts that money and a bubble are &lt;i&gt;the same thing&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Both are anomalously overvalued assets.&amp;nbsp; Both obtain their anomalous value from the fact that many people have bought the asset, without any intention to use it, but only to exchange it for some other asset at a later date.&amp;nbsp; The two can be distinguished only in hindsight.&amp;nbsp; If it popped, it was a bubble.&amp;nbsp; If not, money - so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any realistic economy, real or virtual, there is a demand for at least one good which is used as a &quot;store of value,&quot; that is, not used or intended to be used by the owner, but owned simply to transfer purchasing power across time.&amp;nbsp; Nonetheless, the owner holds this good and participates in the market for it.&amp;nbsp; If many owners standardize on the same good, they affect the market for this good.&amp;nbsp; We can think of their collective purchasing power as a sort of &quot;energy&quot; that flows into this market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It turns out that the correct &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_equilibrium&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;collective strategy&lt;/a&gt; in this game is for everyone to standardize on the same asset as a store of value, and for this asset to be one of intrinsically limited quantity.&amp;nbsp; If the quantity is not limited, as for example in a manufactured good, a stable pool of savers will not increase its price.&amp;nbsp; If the quantity is limited, as with gold, Bitcoin, etc, the price will increase as savings energy flows in - and, of course, decrease as it flows back out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no way to eradicate this effect from anything like a realistic economy.&amp;nbsp; There is always at least one bubble.&amp;nbsp; Ideally, this bubble is stable, and we call it &quot;money.&quot;&amp;nbsp; If you try to spread savings energy across all the goods in the economy, it will stay in storable goods and not in un-storable ones.&amp;nbsp; It will flee from manufactured goods and end up in rare collectibles.&amp;nbsp; Finally, it will flee from a broad spectrum of collectible assets and end up in a single standard.&amp;nbsp; Those who are late in fleeing are, by definition, caught in a bubble which pops - and taste the pain. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might imagine that investment transactions would neutralize or at least reduce the demand for money.&amp;nbsp; Not so.&amp;nbsp; True, instead of holding cash, you can hold a debt - a promise of cash delivered next year.&amp;nbsp; Your demand for cash, and your impact on the price of cash, is now zero.&amp;nbsp; However, the economy&#39;s demand to save cash is unchanged.&amp;nbsp; In exchange for that debt, you gave someone else a bunch of cash.&amp;nbsp; She is now the saver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bitcoin is an exceptionally pure test of the BTM, because it has no intrinsic utility.&amp;nbsp; It is uncomfortably reminiscent of that apex specimen of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Sea_Company&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;South Sea Bubble&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;a company for carrying out an undertaking of great advantage, but nobody to know what it is.&quot;&amp;nbsp; One of the problems with the South Sea Bubble - in fact, one of the reasons why South Sea Company stock could not become a new monetary standard - was the inability to define a reason why one security should be the standard, and not another.&amp;nbsp; There are Bitcoin clones, all more or less worthless.&amp;nbsp; Bitcoin is a protocol standard, and everyone in our era knows how protocol standards play: winner takes all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When we define the essential characteristic of &quot;moneyness&quot; as overvaluation, not as currency, we see that commerce in Bitcoin has no direct relevance at all to its price.&amp;nbsp; If you are spending in Bitcoin, you are not holding it.&amp;nbsp; All that affects the BTC/USD exchange rate is the order book of the people who hold BTC and are willing to sell it for USD, and vice versa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Indeed, it is logically possible to imagine an economy in which the medium of saving and the medium of exchange are different assets, and the medium of saving is overvalued but the medium of exchange is not.&amp;nbsp; This actually happens in seriously mismanaged Third World countries, in which all savings flees to gold or hard currency, and the soft currency is held only for immediate commerce.&amp;nbsp; Often with an inflation rate of double digits per month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;History has never seen a pure monetary standard like Bitcoin.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s not only that gold has intrinsic material utility - even fiat currency, though tremendously overvalued by savings energy, has intrinsic value.&amp;nbsp; Try paying your taxes without it.&amp;nbsp; Dollars will not become worthless even if Bitcoin becomes the global monetary standard, because dollar-denominated liabilities will remain.&amp;nbsp; However, considering the price of Bitcoins in this outcome, these debts will become macroeconomically quite easy to pay - an unqualified boon in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dollar is already the global monetary standard - what creates any incentive to switch to Bitcoin?&amp;nbsp; If the dollar was financially perfect, there would be no such incentive.&amp;nbsp; The dollar is anything but financially perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Probably the easiest way to see this is to consolidate dollars, Treasury notes, and in fact all securities explicitly or implicitly supported by the US Government - a strong argument could be made that this set now includes both the stock market and the real-estate market - as USG liabilities.&amp;nbsp; To put it crudely, a dollar is a share of stock in America.&amp;nbsp; Like a frequent-flier mile (which is also a liability), it confers no explicit rights, but can be redeemed for valuable privileges (especially on April 15).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set of liabilities is constantly expanding - quite a bit more rapidly than the Bitcoin pool.&amp;nbsp; In plain English, USG leaks money.&amp;nbsp; It bleeds, in fact, like a stuck pig.&amp;nbsp; When we do accounting in a diluting equity like this, the rational way to track our positions is not by the number of shares, but by the percentage of ownership.&amp;nbsp; If we adopt this &quot;normalized accounting,&quot; we see that normalized money is constantly being sucked out of our bank accounts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately for those who live in America, normalized accounting also shows us that consumer prices in America are constantly dropping.&amp;nbsp; Price deflation is the rule.&amp;nbsp; Consumer price indexes show negligible price changes in non-normalized accounting, not only because they are fudged and rigged, but because prices are set by dollars competing for goods.&amp;nbsp; Because American spenders have fewer and fewer normalized dollars to spend every year, normalized consumer prices are also dropping. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the quantity of these normalized dollars is constant, so they have to go somewhere.&amp;nbsp; Where do they go?&amp;nbsp; To Asia and to rich people, generally.&amp;nbsp; If we look at the prices, normalized or not, of the assets that Asians and rich people buy, we see these prices going up.&amp;nbsp; Rather rapidly.&amp;nbsp; So, for these people (who hold quite a few dollars), the dollar is a rather poor store of value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because it seems unimaginable that USG will repair its hemorrhaging finances, the opportunity exists for a sounder monetary standard to outcompete its notes.&amp;nbsp; However, it is only an opportunity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;USG, now and for the near-term foreseeable future, can kill Bitcoin &lt;a href=&quot;http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2013/03/rip-bitcoin-i-think.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;dead as a stone&lt;/a&gt; by rendering it ineffective as a store of value, simply by using its gargantuan physical force to prohibit exchange of Bitcoin for dollars.&amp;nbsp; Even a credible threat to shut down the exchanges will result in an enormous demand to flee from Bitcoin, effectively popping the bubble.&amp;nbsp; If the exchanges are really and truly killed, there will be a billion dollars of Bitcoin market capitalization that has no practical way to escape.&amp;nbsp; The holders of this Bitcoin will write it off as worthless - like South Sea or &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi_Company&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mississippi Company&lt;/a&gt; stock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best thing about this outcome, from USG&#39;s perspective, is that to those who lost money in the Bitcoin bubble, it will seem like their own fault for being such fools.&amp;nbsp; True, as a result of USG actions, their personal net worth might drop vertiginously in an afternoon.&amp;nbsp; But it&#39;s not that the evil government &lt;i&gt;confiscated&lt;/i&gt; their Bitcoins - rather, that the market betrayed them.&amp;nbsp; As with any bubble that pops.&amp;nbsp; So, just as 300 years ago, no political resistance can save the bubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, suppose Bitcoin is money?&amp;nbsp; At this point, I can guarantee it.&amp;nbsp; Either USG will kill Bitcoin, which it can and probably will, or Bitcoin will be the new monetary standard.&amp;nbsp; In this case, &lt;a href=&quot;http://falkvinge.net/2011/05/29/why-im-putting-all-my-savings-into-bitcoin/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Rick Falkvinge&#39;s projections&lt;/a&gt; are quite conservative.&amp;nbsp; Simply dividing dollar supply, however defined, by Bitcoin quantity, is an extremely incorrect way to project the USD/BTC exchange rate.&amp;nbsp; On the other hand, there is no better way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a world in which the entire pool of savings energy has moved to Bitcoin, what is a dollar worth?&amp;nbsp; On the one hand, enormous dollar debts exist.&amp;nbsp; On the other hand, those debts themselves must be valued as securities in Bitcoin.&amp;nbsp; As the BTC price increases into the millions, the purchasing power to pay off all the dollar debts - simply by cashing in a few Bitcoins - appears with it.&amp;nbsp; There are no significant Bitcoin debts, and nor will there be any until the transition has completed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a scenario in which no one wants to hold either dollars, or dollar-denominated debts, because the purchasing power of these assets in Bitcoin is constantly decreasing.&amp;nbsp; (Note that it is already decreasing - at quite a rapid clip.)&amp;nbsp; The dollar is now the bubble, and devil take the hindmost.&amp;nbsp; The savings pool evacuates this bubble, but it does not evacuate evenly or all at once.&amp;nbsp; Rather, those who get out first (like Rick Falkvinge!) become much wealthier than they were before.&amp;nbsp; Those who get out last, however, can see a fortune shrink to a pittance.&amp;nbsp; This is classic hyperinflation.&amp;nbsp; A currency never hyperinflates by itself - it always hyperinflates relative to some other medium of saving.&amp;nbsp; There is always a savings pool, and always an overvalued asset.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tangible assets - stocks and real estate - do better.&amp;nbsp; Across a monetary transition, a house remains a house.&amp;nbsp; You can still live in it.&amp;nbsp; On the other hand, the price of a house or a stock, relative to cash, is determined by interest rates.&amp;nbsp; Before the reboot, it is determined by USD interest rates.&amp;nbsp; After the reboot, it is determined by &lt;i&gt;Bitcoin&lt;/i&gt; interest rates - which are effectively infinite during the transition, and relatively high even when the savings pool stabilizes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why relatively high?&amp;nbsp; Because they reflect the actual collective &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_value_of_money&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;time preference&lt;/a&gt; of savers and borrowers, rather than the political incentives of Professor Bernanke.&amp;nbsp; We have no way of knowing what interest rates in a free market would look like - all we know is that ours are way too low, resulting in extreme malinvestment and way way way too much debt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the most significant effects of this unlikely, but awesome, transition are &lt;i&gt;political&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp;

Yes, a world in which governments were subject to ordinary accounting reality, and could not fund themselves by expanding their balance sheets, would be a &lt;a href=&quot;http://books.google.com/books?id=up0CAAAAYAAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA57&amp;amp;lpg=PA57&amp;amp;dq=carlyle+great+is+bankruptcy&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=OvX-lkYq2F&amp;amp;sig=nlay3QBBAxndiU5h71Ac2ynaWLc&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ei=22RiUdqTGueWiALqvIDgDA&amp;amp;ved=0CFwQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=carlyle%20great%20is%20bankruptcy&amp;amp;f=false&quot;

The greatest of these fortunes have of course passed out of individual hands and into those of foundation managers.&amp;nbsp; As with Obi-Wan, this has not lessened their power at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When instead of being determined by whose ancestors cornered oil in 1896, the distribution of great fortunes is determined by who bought Bitcoin when 10K BTC would buy a pizza - really, a no less arbitrary function - we see the balance of wealth, and hence the balance of power, in the hands of very different kinds of people.&amp;nbsp; What changes this would bring - no one can know.&amp;nbsp; Probably none, as it will never happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I have no Bitcoin.&amp;nbsp; Which is not because I disdain the great bet - but just because I&#39;m a poor student of history.&amp;nbsp;

target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Felix Salmon&lt;/a&gt; has a very good job.&amp;nbsp; He gets paid - and paid well - to pretend to think.&amp;nbsp; He&#39;s very good at it.&amp;nbsp; You have to respect anyone who&#39;s good at his job.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if by some misfortune you are actually capable of thinking for yourself and, worse, enjoy it, you cannot have Felix&#39;s job or any job like it.&amp;nbsp; Not only is Felix not paid to think, he is not &lt;i&gt;allowed&lt;/i&gt; to think.&amp;nbsp; Thinking is above his pay grade, as they say in the military.&amp;nbsp; A private who thinks he&#39;s Napoleon is not only not Napoleon, but not a very good private.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rather, Felix&#39;s job (as with all legitimate journalists or columnists - though the former are not even allowed to &lt;i&gt;pretend&lt;/i&gt; to think, which must really sting) is to communicate the thoughts of his sources, rewording them as if they were his own thoughts.&amp;nbsp; His sources are legitimate thinkers - professors, policymakers, and priests.&amp;nbsp; Just kidding.&amp;nbsp; Obviously there are no priests.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nonetheless, his sources (no sources, no journalist) have obtained distinguished titles at important institutions, which is (a) very difficult and (b) something Felix probably once tried to do, but couldn&#39;t.&amp;nbsp; If he disagreed with these distinguished sources, humbly and respectfully offering his own contrary opinion, they would look very puzzled, as though their golden retriever had attempted to engage them in a debate about Thomas Aquinas instead of fetching the goddamn ball.&amp;nbsp; Then, they would find a new dog.&amp;nbsp; An excellent fido is our Felix - but the planet has no shortage of dogs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is fundamentally erroneous for an Internet crank like me to argue with one of these microphones.&amp;nbsp; You might as well argue with a dog, or a lamppost, or anything else that can&#39;t change its mind.&amp;nbsp; My beef is with the sources, or rather, the institutions.&amp;nbsp; Or rather, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://foseti.wordpress.com/2012/07/27/the-three-branches-of-usg/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;institution&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(There is really no one these days who gets paid to think.&amp;nbsp; The difference between Felix and his sources is only that Felix knows he is not really thinking, whereas &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Eichengreen&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;his&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Krugman&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;sources&lt;/a&gt; actually believe they are.&amp;nbsp; Nonetheless, they would not have obtained their important positions had they thought differently.&amp;nbsp; And might even lose them, or at least sink a little, if they changed their minds.&amp;nbsp; Our Cathedral is made of real stones and real mortar and is quite invulnerable to mere windy thought.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nonetheless, Felix is an excellent fido and has a knack for catchy summarization.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s not as easy as it looks.&amp;nbsp; His Gladwellian airport-bestseller product is full of transparent FUD, like &quot;OMG haxx0rs!&quot;, to which a response would demean us both.&amp;nbsp; Pretending to think is one thing.&amp;nbsp; Blatant padding, another. But there are a couple of vaguely substantive anti-Bitcoin points which deserve an equally snappy response from someone with, if I may be so modest, a clue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first is the &quot;argument from instability&quot;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;This is actually a serious problem, if you’re trying to put together a currency, rather than a vehicle for financial speculation. If the currency of a country ever fluctuated as much as bitcoins did, it would never be taken seriously as a medium of exchange: how are you meant to do business in a place where an item costing one unit of currency is worth $10 one day and $20 the next?&lt;/blockquote&gt;First, every currency is a &quot;vehicle for financial speculation.&quot;&amp;nbsp; When you exchange good X for currency A on Tuesday, you are speculating that you will be able to exchange your A for good Y on Thursday.&amp;nbsp; This is a guess about the future, ie, &quot;speculation.&quot;&amp;nbsp; Moreover, by choosing to use A as an intermediary rather than B, you are speculating that the exchange rate A/B will not change in B&#39;s favor between Tuesday and Thursday.&amp;nbsp; Otherwise you would have chosen B.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(It&#39;s typical of our thoughtfree age that a successful financial columnist feels no qualms about using the word &quot;speculation&quot; as a pejorative.&amp;nbsp; Can anti-Semitic rabbis be far behind?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, Felix&#39;s sources will tell him that a currency has two roles: storing purchasing power and solving the coincidence-of-wants problem.&amp;nbsp; This is because Felix&#39;s sources are thinking thoughts last actually thought in the 1930s, ie, before computers.&amp;nbsp; With these magical devices, coincidence of wants is not in principle a problem, though small frictional effects persist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is trivial to do business in Bitcoin when BTC/USD is unstable.&amp;nbsp; Simply post the price in USD, and use the BTC/USD exchange rate as of the transaction date.&amp;nbsp; Even if buyer and seller are both saving in USD, within a couple of seconds they can exchange in, send Bitcoin, and exchange out.&amp;nbsp; The prices realized may differ slightly from the posted estimate, but only slightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the 21st century, a currency has only one role: storing purchasing power.&amp;nbsp; Or to be more exact, containing the inevitable overvaluation of at least one asset in an economy where many actors want to store purchasing power.&amp;nbsp; If you can use this store of value directly in transactions, nice.&amp;nbsp; Nonetheless, rational actors will &quot;speculate&quot; on their optimal store of value, and convert on the fly if needed.&amp;nbsp; Using, you know, computers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It falls under &quot;padding,&quot; but I can&#39;t resist this moment in which our Felix truly plays his shill card:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The overwhelming majority of dollars in the world are deposited safely and electronically in banks: there’s something weird and self-defeating about the kind of people who keep their savings stuffed under the mattress. In Hollywood, if you show someone counting out huge sums of cash, that’s an easy way for the director to say that he’s a criminal.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oddly, I actually lived in Cyprus when I was a kid.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s a dangerous practice for a fido to keep his boilerplate stuffed under the mattress.&amp;nbsp; He&#39;s paid well by the word - the product should be fresh.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s also dangerous to channel Bulgakov, whom Felix probably hasn&#39;t heard of but can Google:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&#39;In Sawa Potapovich&#39;s masterly interpretation we have just heard the story of &quot;The Covetous Knight.&quot;&amp;nbsp; That knight saw himself as a Casanova; but as you saw, nothing came of his efforts, no nymphs threw themselves at him, the muses refused him their tribute, he built no palaces and instead he finished miserably after an attack on his hoard of money and jewels.&amp;nbsp; I warn you that something of the kind will happen to you, if not worse, unless you hand over your foreign currency!&#39;&lt;br /&gt;It may have been Pushkin&#39;s verse or it may have been the compere&#39;s prosaic remarks which had such an effect; at all events a timid voice was heard from the audience:&lt;br /&gt;&#39;I&#39;ll hand over my currency.&#39;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;Please come up on stage,&#39; was the compere&#39;s welcoming response as he peered into the dark auditorium.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;A short blond man, three weeks  unshaven,  appeared  on  stage. &lt;br /&gt;     &#39;What  is  your  name,  please? &#39;  enquired  the  compere. &lt;br /&gt;     &#39;Nikolai  Kanavkin &#39;  was  the  shy  answer. &lt;br /&gt;     &#39;Ah!  Delighted,  citizen  Kanavkin.  Well? &#39; &lt;br /&gt;     &#39;I&#39;ll  hand  it  over.&#39; &lt;br /&gt;     &#39;How  much? &#39; &lt;br /&gt;    &#39;A  thousand  dollars  and  twenty  gold  ten-rouble pieces.&#39; &lt;br /&gt;     &#39;Bravo!  Is  that  all  you  have?  [...] Where are they hidden?&#39; &lt;br /&gt;     &#39;At my aunt&#39;s, in Prechistenka.&#39;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;And where have you put them?&#39;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;In a box in the cellar.&#39;&lt;br /&gt;The actor clasped his hands.&lt;br /&gt;&#39;Oh, no!&amp;nbsp; Really!&#39; he cried angrily.&amp;nbsp; &#39;It&#39;s so damp there -- they&#39;ll grow moldy!&amp;nbsp; People like that aren&#39;t to be trusted with money!&amp;nbsp; What child-like innocence.&amp;nbsp; What will they do next?&lt;br /&gt;Kanavkin, realizing that he was doubly at fault, hung his curly head.&lt;br /&gt;&#39;Money,&#39; the actor went on, &#39;should be kept in the State Bank, in dry and specially guarded strongrooms, but never in your aunt&#39;s cellar, where apart from anything else, the rats may get at it.&amp;nbsp; Really, Kanavkin, you should be ashamed: you -- a grown man!&#39;&lt;br /&gt;Kanavkin did not know which way to look and could only twist the hem of his jacket with his finger.&lt;br /&gt;&#39;All right,&#39; the artist relented slightly, &#39;since you have owned up we&#39;ll be lenient...&#39; Suddenly he added unexpectedly: &#39;By the way... we might as well kill two birds with one stone and not waste a car journey... I expect your aunt has some of her own hidden away, hasn&#39;t she?&#39;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Okay, that&#39;s cheap.&amp;nbsp; But it is simply lovely how much our fido loves his loving master:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Because it turns out that financial-services companies are a very important part of any democracy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s because we place so much trust in banks, after all, that they are forced to take on a great deal of responsibility. Banks and central banks are given an important job to do, are regulated and scrutinized, and can be held responsible for their actions. The population of the entire country, as represented by the government, stands behind bank deposits and promises to honor them even if the bank goes bust. Money, in other words, is a key ingredient in the glue which keeps the social compact together. (What we’re seeing in Cyprus is in large part a demonstration of what happens when that compact starts becoming unglued.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bitcoin, in that sense, is &lt;i&gt;anti-democratic&lt;/i&gt;...&lt;/blockquote&gt;Dare I suggest that Fido understands 21st-century democracy perfectly?&amp;nbsp; &quot;The population of the entire country, as represented by the government.&quot;&amp;nbsp; And hence, transitively, by J.P. Morgan.&amp;nbsp; I would love to have made it up.&amp;nbsp; Crap, &lt;i&gt;Orwell&lt;/i&gt; would love to have made it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there is substance here, or pseudo-substance anyway.&amp;nbsp; The cornerstone of the attack on the kulaks and Kanavkins:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;Inflation is bad, but deflation is worse. The reason is that in a deflationary environment, no one spends money — because whatever you want to buy is sure to become cheaper in a few days or weeks. People hoard their cash, and spend it only begrudgingly, on absolute necessities. And they certainly don’t spend it on hiring people — no matter how productive their employees might be, they’d still be better off just holding on to that money and not paying anybody anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The result is an economy which would simply grind to a halt, with massive unemployment and almost no economic activity. In a word, it would be a Depression. In order to have economic growth, you need monetary growth as well — and that’s something which is impossible to achieve in a bitcoin-based system. Currencies such as the dollar, with a central bank which can print money at will, have succeeded for a reason. As economies grow, the money supply has to be able to grow with them. And that’s why bitcoin can never really succeed over the long term.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&quot;In order to have economic growth, you need monetary growth as well.&quot;&amp;nbsp; But standing in its way - the Covetous Knight again!&amp;nbsp; A Trotskyist, a hoarder and a wrecker!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Surprisingly, this is perfectly true.&amp;nbsp; Actually, the key to understanding this argument is to understand that everything in it is true - if you look at it from the right perspective.&amp;nbsp; Or at least, the fido&#39;s perspective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;In order to have economic growth, you need monetary growth as well.&amp;nbsp; Why?&amp;nbsp; Because &quot;economic growth&quot; means &quot;increase in the number of monetary units spent by consumers.&quot;&amp;nbsp; In order to increase the number of dollars that consumers spend, consumers need to have more dollars.&amp;nbsp; But is this &quot;real&quot; growth, ie, more and better products, or &quot;nominal&quot; growth, ie, just &quot;inflation?&quot;&amp;nbsp; Our hedonics experts will be looking closely at the quality of the products to ascertain this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;At this point, a person actually addicted to the vice of &lt;i&gt;thought&lt;/i&gt; might ask: in an economy with a fixed number of dollars, is it possible to have constant dollar spending, for more and better products?&amp;nbsp; Ie, in fido language, zero &quot;nominal&quot; growth, but positive &quot;real&quot; growth?&amp;nbsp; What an odd idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But again, Fido turns out to be perfectly right.&amp;nbsp; It is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; possible to fix the quantity of dollars in our economy, because the quantity of dollars &lt;i&gt;sensu stricto&lt;/i&gt; (that is, liabilities of the Federal Reserve) is vastly disproportionate to the quantity of debt (market capitalization of the financial system).&amp;nbsp; By well over an order of magnitude.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Imagine a Bitcoin economy in which there were only 20 million Bitcoins, but 200 million promises to deliver future Bitcoins.&amp;nbsp; It is easy to see that this debt could not possibly be valued at par.&amp;nbsp; If we started with it valued at par, we would see the effective dilution of the Bitcoin market by a flood of effectively bogus promises.&amp;nbsp; But the market, being a market, would rapidly unravel this scam and devalue the bogus promises - increasing the exchange rate of a real BTC over a bogus promise, and also increasing the exchange rate of a real BTC against all other goods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At a macroeconomic level, this would constitute a gigantic depression, exactly as Felix describes.&amp;nbsp; The fault would be not on the hands of those who exposed and detonated the debt bomb, but those who built and maintained it.&amp;nbsp; In the dollar debt bomb, continuous monetary expansion is needed to keep the plutonium core stable, which is why Good Professor Ben is lending us $85 billion a month.&amp;nbsp; With this mega-stimulus, spending scrapes along the bottom in a stagnant desultory way.&amp;nbsp; Without it, the core begins to contract, accelerates and then implodes - just as Irving Fisher (who originally thought &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt_deflation&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this thought&lt;/a&gt;) explained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately, there is no significant debt in Bitcoin.&amp;nbsp; In fact, BTC appreciation is a &lt;i&gt;therapy&lt;/i&gt; for the dollar&#39;s debt bomb - because as the &quot;bubble&quot; expands, dollar purchasing power is created out of nowhere.&amp;nbsp; If BTC has the unlikely luck to run to fixation and become the world&#39;s standard currency, San Francisco will be full of dollar billionaires, who will spend these dollars - creating consumer spending, ie, inflationary purchasing power.&amp;nbsp; It would be too much to say this would be a good outcome for everyone, but it would certainly be a good outcome for those in debt. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moreover, a healthy macroeconomic system with a fixed currency supply will not create a debt bomb.&amp;nbsp; Debt bombs are created when unpayable debts are guaranteed, formally or informally, by governments who want to profit surreptitiously from seignorage - generally, in the 20C, as part of some scheme to increase consumer spending.&amp;nbsp; USG itself cannot mint BTC.&amp;nbsp; So it cannot dilute the BTC supply with bogus BTC which are half bad debt, half &quot;FDIC put.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s also true that during the transition to BTC, no debt will be produced and there will be no significant BTC financial system.&amp;nbsp; Real debt requires the power to profit by selling future currency for a discount against present currency.&amp;nbsp; In a USD economy in which BTC is rising at 5% a day, or whatever, there is no way to complete this loop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &quot;deflation&quot; of BTC against USD is simply a function of the shifting volume of savings between the two currencies.&amp;nbsp; At present, almost all savings are in USD (and friends).&amp;nbsp; As tiny amounts of this energy flow into BTC, BTC goes up like a rocket.&amp;nbsp; Of course, the contest is unstable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when the entire savings pool has flowed into BTC, leaving the demonetized USD priced &lt;i&gt;as a financial instrument for its expected return in BTC&lt;/i&gt; (ie, a dollar is a share of stock in USG, which has lots of awesome assets but no cash and no profits), you have an extraordinarily stable financial structure.&amp;nbsp; The quantity of BTC is fixed, by math.&amp;nbsp; The energy in savings is stable, because it corresponds to the real collective desire to defer consumption.&amp;nbsp; Even the debt capitalization is stable, because the quantity of debt depends on the existence of real productive opportunities.&amp;nbsp; I believe quite strongly that in this economy, there would be no such thing as a business cycle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, I fear we&#39;ll never know, because Bitcoin is &lt;a href=&quot;http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2013/03/rip-bitcoin-i-think.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;probably going to be killed by the USG&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Not really for any good reason, not even in self-defense, but just because it&#39;s easy to kill and bureaucrats like killing things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best thing about being a mouthpiece for power.&amp;nbsp; Your predictions come true.&amp;nbsp; You argue that the abandoned church next door is a dangerous firetrap, will probably burn down, and should probably burn down before someone moves into it.&amp;nbsp; It burns down.&amp;nbsp; Good, you say!&amp;nbsp; Are you a master thinker?&amp;nbsp; Or just good friends with a master arsonist?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Power creates opinion.&amp;nbsp; If Bitcoin goes from a billion-dollar capitalization to zero, which will happen if Washington so much as squeezes lightly on its neck, it&#39;s a bubble.&amp;nbsp; The past is always perceived as inevitable.&amp;nbsp; Everyone who bought Bitcoin will feel like the world&#39;s biggest chump.&amp;nbsp; How could anyone have thought it was worth something?&amp;nbsp; When, obviously, it was worth nothing?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, it&#39;s a pity we can&#39;t use actual thoughts as a currency.&amp;nbsp; The quantity is so limited.&amp;nbsp; And always will be.&amp;nbsp;

&quot;If a lion could talk, we could not understand him.&quot;&amp;nbsp; The truth is that a (genuine, not &quot;moderate&quot;) Muslim (or Jew, Christian, Buddhist, Scientologist, etc), though unlike a lion he may speak perfectly good English, is someone who has grown up inside his faith and knows nothing else. You cannot understand him, because the only word he wants to use is &quot;everything.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I also except those, several of of whom I know, who grew up as rationalists but have made a rational decision to convert to orthodox religions, the mustier and more arbitrary the better - generally because the alternative more and more proclaims itself, per Chesterton, not nothing, still less Reason, but the Whore of Babylon in full professional attire.&amp;nbsp; To these friends, Babylon-worship, essentially idolatrous (and speaking to Maimonides&#39; point that idol-worship is self-worship) seems unsatisfying for a grownup, but utterly unacceptable for his children.&amp;nbsp; But still - these people are not genuinely religious, though their kids will be.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A genuinely Muslim Muslim cannot tell us anything about Islam, as the chick within the egg (even a talking chick) can tell us nothing about eggs.&amp;nbsp; The concept of &quot;egg&quot; is not meaningful for her - or to put it differently, it is equivalent to her concept of &quot;universe.&quot;&amp;nbsp; Her universe is two inches in diameter and glows soft-white about half the time.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s warm, well-nourished, and really rather pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And perhaps yet there is a point at which she realizes - in some obscure chick-language - &quot;I am in an egg.&quot;&amp;nbsp; Her universe is not the universe.&amp;nbsp; It is just an egg.&amp;nbsp; What a pity, to live one&#39;s whole chicken life inside an impenetrable sphere, two inches in diameter!&amp;nbsp; To be... in fact... to be &lt;i&gt;crushed&lt;/i&gt;, in fact, by the pressure of my own growing wings.&amp;nbsp; Already I can barely open my beak.&amp;nbsp; Why was I even born in this egg?&amp;nbsp; With wings and a beak?&amp;nbsp; Why, inside an egg, would I even need a beak?&amp;nbsp; But wait -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For there is one brief moment in which the chick can conceive the concept of an egg.&amp;nbsp; The moment before, egg is universe.&amp;nbsp; The moment after - egg is eggshell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An eggshell is not an egg, nor will it ever be.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m sure everyone reading this was once a good 20th-century liberal.&amp;nbsp; Yet we find it a serious, even impossible, struggle, to explain the liberal mind.&amp;nbsp; What, this eggshell?&amp;nbsp; A millimeter thick?&amp;nbsp; Flattened with a footstep?&amp;nbsp; And missing its entire top, whence I dragged my scraggly ass out and sat shivering till my down dried off?&amp;nbsp; This, a universe?&amp;nbsp; &lt;i&gt;My&lt;/i&gt; universe?&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15211&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Elizabeth Bishop&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&lt;span itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/CreativeWork&quot;&gt;I said to myself: three days&lt;br /&gt;and you&#39;ll be seven years old.&lt;br /&gt;I was saying it to stop&lt;br /&gt;the sensation of falling off&lt;br /&gt;the round, turning world,&lt;br /&gt;into cold, blue-black space.&lt;br /&gt;But I felt: you are an I,&lt;br /&gt;you are an Elizabeth,&lt;br /&gt;you are one of them.&lt;br /&gt;Why should you be one, too?&lt;br /&gt;I scarcely dared to look&lt;br /&gt;to see what it was I was.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;span itemscope=&quot;&quot; itemtype=&quot;http://schema.org/CreativeWork&quot;&gt;As a small fortunate Internet miracle, you can see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2013/03/the-permanent-revolution.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Charles Stross&lt;/a&gt; in precisely this evanescent moment - scarcely daring to look to see what it is he is:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;Please don&#39;t deny that you are a believer in this revolutionary ideology — and it &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; revolutionary; so much so that Republican Democracy, Fascism, and Communism are just &lt;i&gt;minor doctrinal disputes&lt;/i&gt; within it. It&#39;s okay to admit it here; &lt;i&gt;I&#39;m&lt;/i&gt; a supporter of this ideology, too. None of us are supporters of feudal  monarchism; we&#39;re all the inheritors of the early &lt;a href=&quot;http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Livre_noir_de_la_R%C3%A9volution_fran%C3%A7aise&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Jacobins&lt;/a&gt;. Which makes  us revolutionaries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it&#39;s important to understand that virtually the entire mainstream of political and social discourse today is radical and revolutionary by historical standards. (Hell, the concept of sociology itself is a construct&amp;nbsp;of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_of_Humanity&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;revolutionary philosophers&lt;/a&gt;.) This is not an historically normative set of touchstone ideas to run a society on. We&#39;re swimming in the tidal wave set running by an underwater earthquake two centuries ago — and like fish that live their entire lives in water, we are unable to see our circumstances as the anomaly that they are, or to know whether it&#39;s all for the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, as Oliver Cromwell &lt;a href=&quot;http://books.google.com/books?id=b4kvAAAAYAAJ&amp;amp;pg=PP7#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false&quot;

three weeks after laying.&amp;nbsp; Or three days before seven.&amp;nbsp; Slightly different when you&#39;re pushing fifty.&amp;nbsp; But better late than never, eh?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, as survivors of this &lt;a href=&quot;http://books.google.com/books?id=FxkUAAAAYAAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA304&amp;amp;dq=meudon+tannery&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ei=o-NUUYLAN4T8iwLTuIHQDQ&amp;amp;ved=0CFwQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=meudon%20tannery&amp;amp;f=false&quot;

is an essential part of the solution.&amp;nbsp; The truth is that some will escape and some won&#39;t.&amp;nbsp; Probably, most won&#39;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it seems almost inevitable that once anyone understands that he&#39;s inside an egg, his next step will be to figure out what his beak is for.&amp;nbsp; An egg is an eggshell.&amp;nbsp; The world outside it is kind of big and &lt;i&gt;certainly&lt;/i&gt; scary.&amp;nbsp; How easy to fall off, into black, turning space!&amp;nbsp; And yet, it&#39;s pretty boring inside an eggshell...</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/feeds/7130325324625352905/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7958140996781104565&amp;postID=7130325324625352905' title='62 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7958140996781104565/posts/default/7130325324625352905'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7958140996781104565/posts/default/7130325324625352905'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2013/03/the-path-to-dark-enlightenment.html' title='The path to (dark) enlightenment'/><author><name>Mencius Moldbug</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/16472157249344139282</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>62</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7958140996781104565.post-777346826721964791</id><published>2013-03-21T07:38:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2013-03-21T07:38:53.144-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Two words for Tyler Cowen and Ilya Somin</title><content type='html'>The words are &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra_vires&quot;

target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ordinary 19th-century legal education&lt;/a&gt;, they&#39;d already know them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After USG is finally razed to the ground, the entire Potomac watershed from Vienna to Gaithersburg restored to pristine pre-Columbian conditions, and North America governed by a couple of smart, hard-working guys and a secretary out of a cozy little office in St. Louis, smart high-school kids will still need to be taught about this monster and why we slew it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When did the contract that was the Constitution become null and void?&amp;nbsp; Obviously, any contract, once breached, is void - another truth you&#39;d learn in an ordinary 19th-century legal education.&amp;nbsp; In fact the reality is that a constitution cannot be a contract, for a contract requires an enforcing agency superior to both parties.&amp;nbsp; Were we still in love with Lockean political theory, we might say that the Sovereign People was the enforcing party and resumed the powers they had contracted away.&amp;nbsp; But Lockean political theory went into the Potomac with the Washington Monument and now provides a habitat only to the rapidly rebounding and perennially delicious Chesapeake blue crab.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given that America&#39;s Sovereign People, if truly sovereign, took a sweet two centuries and change in asserting that sovereignty, there are as many answers to the question as there were GS-15s in Bethesda.&amp;nbsp; But we can still evaluate this Constitution as a supposed contract, and at least count the fistulae where Washington nailed it once too often in the tail.&amp;nbsp; Moreover, since smart high-school kids love compelling simplicities, we can pick one main hole or &lt;i&gt;cloaca maxima&lt;/i&gt;, and select it arbitrarily as &lt;i&gt;the&lt;/i&gt; orifice through which this national bowel, so often violated beyond nature&#39;s nightmare, finally prolapsed beyond repair and tangled permanently round our combat boots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is the charge?&amp;nbsp; The &lt;i&gt;main&lt;/i&gt; charge?&amp;nbsp; The main charge, I assert, is that USG post 1945 breached the Constitution irreparably by operating &lt;i&gt;ultra vires&lt;/i&gt; as a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickriver.com/photos/thomwatson/15183229/#large&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;world government&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The so-called &quot;international&quot; agencies of this period, like the risible &quot;United Nations,&quot; were established by USG and creatures of it.&amp;nbsp; In fact rather than name, they were merely new tentacles of the State Department, not bound by the archaic restriction to employ only American citizens.&amp;nbsp; USG&#39;s &quot;withdrawal&quot; from the UN was like Russia&#39;s &quot;withdrawal&quot; from the Warsaw Pact.&amp;nbsp; This institution of socialist brotherhood did not mope in exile pining for its founding big brother - but simply ceased to exist.&amp;nbsp; Obviously.&amp;nbsp; I mean, obviously in retrospect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even what we called our &quot;friends&quot; and &quot;allies&quot; in this &quot;international community&quot; turned out to be no such thing, but rather despicable puppet regimes of foreign nationality but American loyalty.&amp;nbsp; The great &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.constitution.org/vattel/vattel_01.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Vattel&lt;/a&gt; described this phenomenon with his usual succinctness:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;-webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; color: black; font-family: Times; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;But a people that has passed under the dominion of another is no longer a state, and can no longer avail itself directly of the law of nations. Such were the nations and kingdoms which the Romans rendered subject to their empire; the generality even of those whom they honoured with the name of friends and allies no longer formed real states. Within themselves they were governed by their own laws and magistrates; but without, they were in every thing obliged to follow the orders of Rome; they dared not of themselves either to make war or contract alliances; and could not treat with nations.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Of course these quislings, traitors to their own nations, were not loyal to &lt;i&gt;America&lt;/i&gt;, but rather to &lt;i&gt;Washington&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; But from the perspective of, say, France, it made no difference:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/NpDi27DrCVk&quot; width=&quot;560&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the transition our dear puppets kept phoning their masters, in excellent English of course, but could not get an answer.&amp;nbsp; Sometimes the line would pick up, but emit no English - only a sort of wet &lt;i&gt;scuttling&lt;/i&gt; noise, suggestive of the Maryland blue crab with its exquisitely evolved hind paddles. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bees without a queen are pretty helpless.&amp;nbsp; It didn&#39;t take long for the French and others to get the idea.&amp;nbsp; As Americans, of course, it&#39;s hard to support what they did.&amp;nbsp; But as Americans, we don&#39;t have to.&amp;nbsp; Besides, France has a pretty long tradition of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Bartholomew%27s_Day_massacre&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this kind of thing&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Hot-blooded Latins and all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But wait - as Americans, why should we mind if Washington conquers the world?&amp;nbsp; Isn&#39;t it awesome, always and everywhere, to rule?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not at all.&amp;nbsp; The doctrine of &lt;i&gt;ultra vires&lt;/i&gt; exists for a reason.&amp;nbsp; Every institution, private or public, is chartered to serve the interests and purposes of its beneficiaries.&amp;nbsp; If it decides it has the right to trade off the interests of those beneficiaries, purportedly for the purpose of serving other beneficiaries to whom it is not contractually responsible, but has decided to love simply out of the goodness of its gigantic and perpetually hemorrhaging heart -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When USG decided it had the right &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; to serve the people of America, to whom it was exclusively responsible, it set the precedent that it could abuse American interests &lt;i&gt;for any purpose it desired&lt;/i&gt;. &amp;nbsp; And what other precedent could tyranny demand?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;USG certainly was never responsible to any &lt;i&gt;other&lt;/i&gt; party.&amp;nbsp; Operating &lt;i&gt;ultra vires&lt;/i&gt; as a world government, like any regime it worked assiduously to curry the &lt;a href=&quot;http://transition.usaid.gov/pk/newsroom/news/growth/110104.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;favor&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of its foreign subjects.&amp;nbsp; But how could it possibly be &lt;i&gt;responsible&lt;/i&gt; to the mango farmers of Pakistan?&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No - in its capacity as planetary benefactor, USG could only be utterly irresponsible and autocratic.&amp;nbsp; In time it probably would have followed the example of Rome and extended the citizenship of the metropolis to the entire empire.&amp;nbsp; Not that this would have given foreigners any more real authority over &quot;their&quot; government than Americans already enjoyed.&amp;nbsp; But at least it would have fixed the optics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And why?&amp;nbsp; Why this amazing planetary empire?&amp;nbsp; Ostensibly, we were told, the motive was the benefit of humanity.&amp;nbsp; What a purpose!&amp;nbsp; What benefit!&amp;nbsp; The progressive global leadership that at home produced &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUbsw28PCpA&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Clockwork Orange Detroit&lt;/a&gt; also gave us &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.fr/France-orange-m%C3%A9canique-Laurent-Obertone/dp/B009S2LKLY&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Clockwork Orange France&lt;/a&gt;, Clockwork Orange South Africa, Clockwork Orange Haiti, Clockwork Orange Syria, etc, etc, etc.&amp;nbsp; Nor may we forget its earlier patronage of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.unz.org/Pub/HarperSamuel-1945&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Clockwork Orange Russia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://foseti.wordpress.com/2012/08/19/review-of-americas-retreat-from-victory-by-joseph-r-mccarthy/&quot;

Hitler was an amateur and Mao was a cheap local punk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, there is a simpler reason.&amp;nbsp; Washington loved it.&amp;nbsp; It was not America that got to rule the world, but Washington.&amp;nbsp; This amazing global empire was responsible neither to Americans, nor to foreigners; neither did it serve the interests of either.&amp;nbsp; The interests it served were its own.&amp;nbsp; How fortunate we are that this monster is at the bottom of a river!&amp;nbsp; Happy the crabs that feast on its corse!&amp;nbsp; May never drought undrown its bones!&amp;nbsp; Roll on, great Potomack, roll.&amp;nbsp; In spring&#39;s floods the bricks do tumble, the waterman hears clicks and clacks and smiles broadly as he casts his net.&amp;nbsp; To trumpets and great pageant the kings are home; the television&#39;s dead; the globe exhales in peace at last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the mouths of Washington&#39;s worm-tongued professors, not all of whom were truly bad people, many of whom later found real meaning and excellence in plumbing, landscaping or driving a cab, the strawman was easily raised that if USG considered only the interests of Americans, it should logically use its planetary dominion to (for example) slaughter the entire population of Brazil for its fresh young transplantable organs.&amp;nbsp; Not so, because Americans were and are not collectively evil and have no intention of committing any such crime.&amp;nbsp; Neither will any institution responsible to them.&amp;nbsp; It is not their interests only that a responsible government is bound to follow, but their purposes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In an international capacity, the purpose of a sovereign people - or any other sane sovereign - is to protect their own rights and respect the rights of others, as laid down by Vattel and other great scholars of the classical European international law.&amp;nbsp; Like so many sound old principles, the good name of international law was perverted by the unspeakable 20th century into a system of transnational domination.&amp;nbsp; Yet the law of nations is a &lt;i&gt;natural&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Ellul&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Jacques Ellul&#39;s&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda:_The_Formation_of_Men%27s_Attitudes&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Propaganda&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;(1962) is neither - it is a pretty good book.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s dated in many ways and has many of the faults of the postwar French intellectual.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nonetheless, Ellul lived and observed in Vichy France, a great laboratory of this black art in which fascist and communist propagandas of every conceivable flavor competed, interacted, and interbred.&amp;nbsp; Here, for instance, is a great summation of the 20th-century achievement in the form:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;The idea that propaganda consists of lies (which makes it harmless and even a little ridiculous in the eyes of the public) is still maintained by some specialists; for example, &lt;a href=&quot;http://books.google.com/books?id=SwoAAAAAMBAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA179&amp;amp;lpg=PA179&amp;amp;dq=frederick+irion&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=DWg1-1qVi5&amp;amp;sig=8a_To_JZqAG_MBigyiOp-ehv9hk&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ei=mpNIUa6oEYf0iQLL_oCgBg&amp;amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=frederick%20irion&amp;amp;f=false&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Frederick C. Irion&lt;/a&gt; gives it as the basic trait in his definition of propaganda.&amp;nbsp; But it is certainly not so.&amp;nbsp; For a long time propagandists have recognized that lying must be avoided.&amp;nbsp; &quot;In propaganda, truth pays off&quot; -- this formula has been increasingly accepted.&amp;nbsp; Lenin proclaimed it.&amp;nbsp; And alongside Hitler&#39;s statement on lying one must place Goebbels&#39; insistence that facts to be disseminated must be accurate.(*)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How can we explain this contradiction?&amp;nbsp; It seems that in propaganda we must make a radical distinction between a fact on the one hand and intentions or interpretations on the other; in brief, between the material and moral elements.&amp;nbsp; The truth that pays off is in the realm of facts.&amp;nbsp; The necessary falsehoods, which also pay off, are in the realm of &lt;i&gt;intentions&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;interpretations&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;This is Propaganda 101.&amp;nbsp; The footnote is also interesting:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;* - This idea is now generally accepted.&amp;nbsp; In the United States it is the Number One rule in propaganda manuals, except for unbelievable and harmful truths, about which it is better to remain silent.&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Headquarters_Allied_Expeditionary_Force&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;SHAEF&lt;/a&gt; said in its manual: &quot;When there is no compelling reason to suppress a fact, tell it... Aside from considerations of military security, the only reason to suppress a piece of news is if it is unbelievable... When the listener catches you in a lie, your power diminishes... For this reason, never tell a lie which can be discovered.&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far back as 1940 the American psychological services already had orders to tell the truth; in carrying them out, for example, they distributed the same newspapers to American and German soldiers.&amp;nbsp; In the Communist bloc we find exactly the same attitude: Mao has always been very careful to state the facts exactly, including bad news.&amp;nbsp; On the basis of Lenin&#39;s general theory of information, it is incorrect that the dissemination of false news does not create problems.&amp;nbsp; French propagandists also have discovered that truthfulness is effective, and that it is better to spread a piece of bad news oneself than to wait until it is revealed by others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There remains the problem of Goebbels&#39; reputation.&amp;nbsp; He wore the title of Big Liar (bestowed by Anglo-Saxon propaganda) and yet he never stopped battling for propaganda to be as accurate as possible.&amp;nbsp; He preferred being cynical and brutal to being caught in a lie.&amp;nbsp; He used to say: &quot;Everybody must know what the situation is.&quot;&amp;nbsp; He was always the first to announce disastrous events or difficult situations, without hiding anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The result was a general belief, between 1939 and 1942, that German communiques were not only more concise, clearer, and less cluttered, but were more truthful than Allied communiques (American and neutral opinion) -- and, furthermore, that the Germans published all the news two or three days before the Allies.&amp;nbsp; All this is so true that pinning the title of Big Liar on Goebbels must be considered quite a propaganda success.&lt;/blockquote&gt;See, you&#39;ve already learned something today! (And it can&#39;t be repeated too often that when Hitler talks about the &quot;Big Lie,&quot; he is accusing his enemies rather than revealing his plans - not, of course, that his own propaganda is anything but propaganda.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The core of Ellul&#39;s work is his explanation of why both the State and the People need propaganda.&amp;nbsp; The former is a straightforward matter we&#39;ve considered &lt;a href=&quot;http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2010/11/democracy-cis-and-trans-maines-law.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;many times&lt;/a&gt; here at UR:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;Ergo: even in a democracy, a government that is honest, serious, benevolent, and respects the voter &lt;i&gt;cannot follow&lt;/i&gt; public opinion.&amp;nbsp; But it &lt;i&gt;cannot escape&lt;/i&gt; it either.&amp;nbsp; The masses are there; they are interested in politics.&amp;nbsp; The government cannot act without them.&amp;nbsp; So, what can it do?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only one solution is possible: as the government cannot follow opinion, opinion must follow the government.&amp;nbsp; One must convince this present, ponderous, impassioned mass that the government&#39;s decisions are legitimate and good and that its foreign policy is correct.&amp;nbsp; The democratic state, precisely because it believes in the expression of public opinion and does not gag it, must channel and shape that opinion if it wants to be realistic and not follow an ideological dream.&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;The most benevolent State will inform the people of what it does.&amp;nbsp; For the government to explain how it acts, why it acts, and what the problems are, makes sense; but when dispensing such information, the government cannot remain coldly objective; &lt;i&gt;it must plead its case&lt;/i&gt;, inevitably, if only to counteract opposing propaganda.&amp;nbsp; [...]&amp;nbsp; And because pure and simple information cannot prevail against modern propaganda techniques, the government, too, must act through propaganda.&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;The American writer &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._Bradford_Westerfield&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bradford Westerfield&lt;/a&gt; has said: &quot;In the United States, the government almost always conducts its foreign policy on its own initiative, but where the public is interested in a particular question, it can only proceed with the &lt;i&gt;apparent support&lt;/i&gt; of a substantial majority of the people.&quot;&amp;nbsp; Westerfield stresses that at times concessions must be made to the people, but &quot;if the President &lt;i&gt;really directs opinion&lt;/i&gt;, and if the public accepts the foreign policy of the government as a whole, no great concessions will have to be made to elicit the necessary support.&quot;&amp;nbsp; Here we find confirmation that any modern State, even a democratic one, is burdened with the task of acting through propaganda.&amp;nbsp; It cannot act otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1957, when the Soviet people were called upon to study and discuss Khrushchev&#39;s Theses on Economic Reorganization, we witnessed a truly remarkable operation.&amp;nbsp; The underlying theme of it all was, of course, that everything is being decided by the people.&amp;nbsp; How can the people then not be in agreement afterward?&amp;nbsp; How can they fail to comply completely with what they have decided in the first place?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Theses were submitted to the people first.&amp;nbsp; Naturally, they were then explained in all the Party organizations, in the Komsomols, in the unions, in the local soviets, in the factories, and so on, by agitprop specialists.&amp;nbsp; Then the discussions took place.&amp;nbsp; Next, &lt;i&gt;Pravda&lt;/i&gt; opened its columns to the public, and numerous citizens sent in comments, expressed their views, suggested amendments.&amp;nbsp; After that, what happened?&amp;nbsp; The entire government program, &lt;i&gt;without the slightest modification&lt;/i&gt;, was passed by the Supreme Soviet.&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;When Fidel Castro wanted to show that his power was based on democratic sentiment, he organized the Day of Justice, during which the whole population was called upon to sit in judgment of the past regime, and to express its sentiments upon massive demonstrations. These demonstrations were meant to &quot;legalize&quot; the death sentences handed down by the State courts and thus give a &quot;democratic sanction&quot; to the judgments. In doing this, Castro won the people&#39;s profound allegiance by satisfying the need for revenge against the former regime and the thirst for blood. He tied the people to the government by the strongest of bonds: the ritual crime. That Day of Justice (January 21, 1959) was undoubtedly a great propagandistic discovery. If it caused Castro some embarrassment abroad, it certainly was a great success at home. It should be noted that such provocation of popular action always serves to support governmental action. It is in no way spontaneous, and in no way expresses an intrinsic desire of the people: it merely expresses through a million throats of the crowd, the cry of governmental propaganda.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second - and this is a subtler process -- governmental propaganda &lt;i&gt;suggests&lt;/i&gt; that public opinion &lt;i&gt;demand&lt;/i&gt; this or that decision; it provokes the will of the people, who spontaneously would say nothing. But, once evoked, formed, and crystallized on a point, that &lt;i&gt;will&lt;/i&gt; becomes the &lt;i&gt;people&#39;s will&lt;/i&gt;; and whereas the government really acts on its own, it gives the impression of obeying public opinion -- after first having built the public opinion. The point is to make the masses demand of the government what the government has already decided to do. If it follows this procedure, the government can no longer be called authoritarian, because the will of the people demands what is being done. In this fashion, when the German public opinion unanimously demanded the liberation of Czechoslovakia, the German government had no choice but to invade that country in obedience to the people. It &lt;i&gt;yielded&lt;/i&gt; to opinion as soon as opinion -- through propaganda -- had become strong enough to appear to influence the government. &lt;/blockquote&gt;Yeah, yeah.&amp;nbsp; We know all this - I hope.&amp;nbsp; But the People need their propaganda too:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;A common view of propaganda is that it is the work of a few evil men, seducers of the people, cheats and authoritarian rulers who want to dominate a population; that it is the handmaiden of more or less illegitimate powers.&amp;nbsp; This view always thinks of propaganda as being made voluntarily; it assumes that a man decides &quot;to make propaganda,&quot; that a government establishes a Propaganda Ministry, and that things just develop from there.&amp;nbsp; According to this view, the public is just an object, a passive crowd that one can manipulate, influence, and use.&amp;nbsp; And this notion is held not only by those who think one can manipulate the crowd, but also by those who think propaganda is not very effective and can be resisted easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In other words, this view distinguishes between an active factor -- the propagandist -- and a passive factor -- the crowd, the mass man.&amp;nbsp; Seen from that angle, it is easy to understand the moralist&#39;s hostility to propaganda: man is the innocent victim pushed into evil ways by the propagandist; the propagandee is entirely without blame because he has been fooled and has fallen into a trap.&amp;nbsp; The militant Nazi and Communist are just poor victims who must not be fought but must be psychologically liberated from that trap, readapted to freedom, and shown the truth.&amp;nbsp; In any case, the propagandee is seen in the role of the poor devil who cannot help himself, who has no means of defense against the bird of prey who swoops down on him from the skies.&amp;nbsp; A similar point of view can be found in studies on advertising which regard the buyer as victim and prey.&amp;nbsp; In all this the propagandee is never charged with the slightest responsibility for a phenomenon regarded as originating entirely outside of himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This view seems to me completely wrong.&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;For propaganda to &lt;i&gt;succeed&lt;/i&gt;, it must correspond to a need for propaganda on the individual&#39;s part.&amp;nbsp; One can lead a horse to water but cannot make him drink; one cannot reach through propaganda those who do not need what it offers.&amp;nbsp; The propagandee is by no means just an innocent victim.&amp;nbsp; He provokes the psychological action of propaganda, and not merely lends himself to it, but even derives satisfaction from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without this previous, implicit consent, without this need for propaganda experienced by practically every citizen of the technological age, propaganda could not spread.&amp;nbsp; There is not just a wicked propagandist who sets up means to ensnare the innocent citizen.&amp;nbsp; Rather, there is a citizen who craves propaganda from the bottom of his being and a propagandist who responds to this craving.&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;I think that propaganda fulfills a need of modern man, a need that creates in him an unconscious desire for propaganda.&amp;nbsp; He is in the position of needing outside help to be able to face his condition.&amp;nbsp; And that help is propaganda.&amp;nbsp; Naturally, he does not say: &quot;I want propaganda.&quot;&amp;nbsp; On the contrary, in line with preconceived notions, he abhors propaganda and considers himself a &quot;free and mature person.&quot;&amp;nbsp; But in reality he calls for and desires propaganda that will permit him to ward off certain attacks and reduce certain tensions.&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;We have stressed that the State can no longer govern without the masses, which nowadays are closely involved in politics.&amp;nbsp; But these masses are composed of individuals.&amp;nbsp; From their point of view, the problem is slightly different: they are interested in politics and consider themselves concerned with politics; even if they are not forced to participate actively because they live in a democracy, they embrace politics as soon as someone wants to take the democratic regime away from them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this presents them with problems that are way over their heads.&amp;nbsp; They are faced with choices and decisions which demand maturity, knowledge, and a range of information which they do not and cannot have.&amp;nbsp; Elections are limited to the selection of individuals, which reduces the problem of participation to its simplest form.&amp;nbsp; But the individual wishes to participate in other ways than just elections.&amp;nbsp; He wants to be conversant with economic questions.&amp;nbsp; In fact, his government asks him to be.&amp;nbsp; He wants to form an opinion on foreign policy.&amp;nbsp; But in reality he can&#39;t.&amp;nbsp; He is caught between his desire and his inability, which he refuses to accept.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For no citizen will believe that he is unable to have opinions.&amp;nbsp; Public opinion surveys always reveal that people have opinions even on the most complicated questions, except for a small minority (usually the most informed and those who have reflected most).&amp;nbsp; The majority prefers expressing stupidities to not expressing opinion: this gives them the feeling of participation.&amp;nbsp; For this they need simple thoughts, elementary explanations, a &quot;key&quot; that will permit them to take a position, and even ready-made opinions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As most people have the desire and at the same time the incapacity to participate, they are ready to accept a propaganda that will permit them to participate, and which hides their incapacity beneath explanations, judgments, and news, enabling them to satisfy their desire without eliminating their incompetence.&amp;nbsp; The more complex, general, and accelerated political and economic phenomena become, the more individuals feel concerned, the more they want to be involved.&amp;nbsp; In a certain sense this is democracy&#39;s gain, but it also leads to more propaganda.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the individual does not want information, but only value judgments and preconceived positions.&amp;nbsp; Here one must also take into account the individual&#39;s laziness, which plays a decisive role in the entire propaganda phenomenon, and the impossibility of transmitting all information fast enough to keep up with developments in the modern world.&amp;nbsp; Besides, the developments are not merely beyond man&#39;s intellectual scope; they are also beyond him in volume and intensity; he simply cannot grasp the world&#39;s economic and political problems.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Faced with such matters, he feels his weakness, his inconsistency, his lack of effectiveness.&amp;nbsp; He realizes that he depends on decisions over which he has no control, and that realization drives him to despair.&amp;nbsp; Man cannot stay in this situation too long.&amp;nbsp; He needs an ideological veil to cover the harsh reality, some consolation, a raison d&#39;etre, a sense of values.&amp;nbsp; And only propaganda offers him a remedy for a basically intolerable situation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;This is all true.&amp;nbsp; Even in 2013, it is true.&amp;nbsp; And yet, it offers some hope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a frequently observed truth of con men that it&#39;s impossible to con an innocent man.&amp;nbsp; It is also impossible to propagandize an innocent man.&amp;nbsp; It is your &lt;i&gt;political ambition&lt;/i&gt; - an original sin if there every was one; when I translate &quot;original sin&quot; into 21st-century English, it comes out as &quot;evolutionary psychology&quot; - that makes you fall for this con.&amp;nbsp; Somehow excising this &lt;i&gt;libido dominandi&lt;/i&gt;, the lust for power, would leave you as immune to propaganda as a tonsillectomy to tonsillitis.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or a castration to porn.&amp;nbsp; Indeed, what Ellul is telling us - a fact which is obvious today, though much less so in 1962 - is that the modern propaganda addict (we cannot call him a victim) experiences political authority, a delicious taste instinctively desired by all men and women of true chimpanzee descent, &lt;i&gt;entirely as porn&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; That is, as a simulation entirely without substance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is there life after porn?&amp;nbsp; In 1962, this seemed impossible and indeed it was.&amp;nbsp; Then again, in 1962, democracy, though not real, included many more living remnants of an age when it was once real.&amp;nbsp; The organized political riot, for instance, remained a reality in every democratic country.&amp;nbsp; Even in America, in the resistance to desegregation, we see political crowds using crude hand weapons and sheer weight of biomass to actively pursue their collective interests against the agenda of the State.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s true that these crowds were weak and were defeated, but it&#39;s also true that they existed.&amp;nbsp; They would be unthinkable today.&amp;nbsp; The Tea Party, the closest thing to their successors, doesn&#39;t even litter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two ways to imagine a realistic life after porn.&amp;nbsp; First, the political libido of the average Westerner has greatly decreased, through absence of reality and overstimulation of falsity.&amp;nbsp; Engagement remains, but has much diminished.&amp;nbsp; Apathy is proverbial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apathy, which is a passive reaction, is not by any means conquest of desire.&amp;nbsp; But it provides a platform for conquest of desire.&amp;nbsp; Moreover, the extraordinary increase, not in the intelligence of the crowd, but in its philosophical sophistication, must be reckoned with.&amp;nbsp; Imagine the impact of a movie like &lt;i&gt;Inception&lt;/i&gt; on the audience of 1962.&amp;nbsp; Irony and &quot;meta&quot; are old hat to quite a large population.&amp;nbsp; Conquest of desire?&amp;nbsp; Zen, or at least the idea of Zen (Zen is an exercise, not an idea), is familiar to essentially anyone who can read.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And second, conquest of desire need not mean elimination of desire.&amp;nbsp; It can mean &lt;i&gt;control&lt;/i&gt; of desire.&amp;nbsp; It is possible to reject porn in favor of celibacy.&amp;nbsp; It is also possible to reject porn in favor of sex.&amp;nbsp; It is true that all superficially plausible channels of conventional political activism are more or less what Patri Friedman calls &quot;folk activism,&quot; ie, porn.&amp;nbsp; But when the impossible is rejected, the implausible becomes possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Power porn, that is, political action compatible with official propaganda (even supposedly anti-government actions can reinforce the narrative, often strongly; Timothy McVeigh was a better propaganda asset than Bill Moyers), is essentially a safety valve that prevents real and effective collective action by bleeding off its energy source.&amp;nbsp; To realize that porn and celibacy are effectively the same choice is also to refocus your sex drive on achieving actual sex.&amp;nbsp; To the porn addict, actual sex seems undesirable, because actual women are never as desirable as porn stars.&amp;nbsp; Learning to overcome this, and becoming accustomed to actual women with actual pubic hair, is the essence of the exercise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, sex differs from power in that sex is individual, where power is collective.&amp;nbsp; It is not sufficient for an individual to overcome his phobia of political pubic hair.&amp;nbsp; It is necessary for a substantial number, if nowhere near a majority, to do so.&amp;nbsp; Is it possible?&amp;nbsp; Is there space for a new and more genuine propaganda, which would genuinely satisfy the libido of the masses, by offering at least the genuine opportunity for genuine authority?&amp;nbsp; Perhaps we&#39;ll see.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/feeds/6794492624264738321/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7958140996781104565&amp;postID=6794492624264738321' title='25 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7958140996781104565/posts/default/6794492624264738321'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7958140996781104565/posts/default/6794492624264738321'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2013/03/jacques-ellul-on-demand-for-propaganda.html' title='Jacques Ellul on the demand for propaganda'/><author><name>Mencius Moldbug</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/16472157249344139282</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>25</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7958140996781104565.post-4031808212612054265</id><published>2013-03-18T20:54:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2013-03-18T21:28:03.950-07:00</updated><title type='text'>RIP Bitcoin, I think</title><content type='html'>As &lt;a href=&quot;http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2013/01/how-bitcoin-dies.html&quot;

(as I read it).&amp;nbsp; So, in a particularly ingenious touch, is mining BTC and selling it for money.&amp;nbsp; Ie, &lt;i&gt;mining BTC&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Ie, it is quite plain that every player in the Bitcoin economy violates this grand ukase of the Holy Procurator - and, if prudent, will begin making plans to shut down permanently, tomorrow. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless, of course, it has a money transmitter license.&amp;nbsp; Obviously, none of these has been or will be issued to any Bitcoiners.&amp;nbsp; I have not of course seen the questionnaire (ha ha - the first question being, can you afford $2.5M in legal fees?), but I imagine it asks you how you know the monies you&#39;re transmitting are not the product of illegal activity.&amp;nbsp; Of course, Bitcoin provides no such assurance.&amp;nbsp; By design.&amp;nbsp; That&#39;s because it&#39;s well-designed - for a free country that doesn&#39;t exist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not matter whether or not USG would issue a BTC exchange an MTL under any circumstances - because BTC will &quot;get dead,&quot; as my daughter puts it, before even the friendliest of regimes could act on such an application.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m not getting the feeling this is the friendliest of regimes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ergo, we can expect the BTC economy to segment rapidly into two groups: those who see the writing on the wall and cash out/cut losses as fast as possible, and those who for whatever reason want to play whack-a-mole with Washington.&amp;nbsp; Washington will have great fun with the latter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the essential problem is that BTC cannot maintain its exchange rate against USD, for reasons discussed in the prior post, without the present burgeoning white economy.&amp;nbsp; The BTC black economy has many ways to fight USG - but it ceases to exist if the white economy ceases to maintain the BTC price above zero.&amp;nbsp; Criminals don&#39;t work for free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, of course, I could be wrong.&amp;nbsp; There is certainly no &lt;i&gt;investment advice&lt;/i&gt; here at UR...</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/feeds/4031808212612054265/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7958140996781104565&amp;postID=4031808212612054265' title='26 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7958140996781104565/posts/default/4031808212612054265'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7958140996781104565/posts/default/4031808212612054265'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2013/03/rip-bitcoin-i-think.html' title='RIP Bitcoin, I think'/><author><name>Mencius Moldbug</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/16472157249344139282</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>26</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7958140996781104565.post-5525744409219863154</id><published>2013-03-12T23:19:00.001-07:00</published><updated>2013-03-14T07:04:44.157-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Sam Altman is not a blithering idiot</title><content type='html'>TL;DR &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Altman&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Sam Altman&lt;/a&gt; is not a blithering idiot.&amp;nbsp; That&#39;s what&#39;s so scary.&amp;nbsp; When the most elitest minds of a society are full of &lt;a href=&quot;http://samaltman.posthaven.com/growth-and-government&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;blithering idiocy&lt;/a&gt;, that society is probably doomed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s normal for geniuses to be &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Frampton&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;crazed&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; But Sam Altman (whom I don&#39;t know, but SF is a small town and I probably know someone who knows him) isn&#39;t a genius and he definitely isn&#39;t crazed.&amp;nbsp; He didn&#39;t analyze any ten-dimensional gauge theory or predict any chiral axigluons.&amp;nbsp; He&#39;s just an entrepreneur, ie, a natural leader, a commodity which especially in our present dire straits is or at least ought to be worth a whole Bolivian prison full of cocaine-tooting particle physicists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I find exceptionally terrifying is that Altman&#39;s blithering idiocy looks and sounds &lt;i&gt;exactly like sober good sense&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href=&quot;http://samaltman.posthaven.com/growth-and-government&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Read it.&lt;/a&gt; You&#39;ll agree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The basic problem with our society is a disconnect between consensus reality and actual reality.&amp;nbsp; We actually have no shortage of natural leaders.&amp;nbsp; But they cannot actually lead us anywhere.&amp;nbsp; They are operating in consensus reality rather than actual reality.&amp;nbsp; Their joysticks are not plugged in.&amp;nbsp; When the consensus is nonsense, sober good sense is nonsense.&amp;nbsp; Nonsense is no use to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really?&amp;nbsp; Can blithering idiocy sound like sober good sense?&amp;nbsp; Let&#39;s try some:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;All of that said, in absolute sense I’d much rather live in the world of today than 1950—it’s tough for me to imagine living in a world without the Internet.  However, in the same way that one can feel acceleration but not velocity, people seem more sensitive to the annual rate of improvement than the absolute quality of life.  So even though people should be happier in an absolutely better world, no one wants to stand still on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;hedonic treadmill&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;Most of us want our lives to get better every year—the hedonic treadmill is a pain that way.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The world of 1950!&amp;nbsp; Oh, honey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, let&#39;s apply a &lt;i&gt;gross&lt;/i&gt; reality check. You&#39;re an alien.&amp;nbsp; You&#39;re observing Earth with an infinitely powerful telescope from Alpha Centauri.&amp;nbsp; You have a simple question.&amp;nbsp; Since 1950, has human civilization - or American civilization, which amounts to pretty much the same these days - advanced or declined?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently the easiest way for Sam Altman to answer the question is to trade it for a different one.&amp;nbsp; He is not alone in this.&amp;nbsp; He asks: since 1950, has human &lt;i&gt;technology&lt;/i&gt; advanced or declined?&amp;nbsp; Clearly, the alien, you, I, and Sam Altman all have the same answer to this question.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any question with an obvious answer is a stupid question.&amp;nbsp; &quot;Is an iPad more advanced than a Smith-Corona?&quot; is a stupid question.&amp;nbsp; Who asks stupid questions?&amp;nbsp; Obviously, blithering idiots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But we can compose an interesting question by &lt;i&gt;factoring out&lt;/i&gt; the stupid question.&amp;nbsp; Which world would Sam Altman rather live in?&amp;nbsp; 2013, with iPads and teh Internet?&amp;nbsp; Or 1950 - with iPads and teh Internet?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a sense, this 1950 is just as real as the &quot;real&quot; 1950.&amp;nbsp; Neither exists.&amp;nbsp; Sam Altman cannot pack his bags and move to either the real 1950 or my imaginary super-1950.&amp;nbsp; Both exist only as thought experiments.&amp;nbsp; It is not hard to construct or define the super-1950, though - one run of a time machine, with a printout of Wikipedia, would be pretty much all the real 1950 needed.&amp;nbsp; Send the technology back to 1945, and you&#39;ll have iPads by &#39;55 at the latest.&amp;nbsp; Those guys got things done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The interesting (and scary) question this thought-experiment asks is whether, &lt;i&gt;aside from technical progress&lt;/i&gt;, human civilization has advanced or declined since 1950.&amp;nbsp; In actual reality, this too is a stupid question.&amp;nbsp; The answer is no less obvious - I assert.&amp;nbsp; But consensus reality thinks I&#39;m crazy.&amp;nbsp; So with stupid we must begin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from technical progress, has human civilization advanced or declined since 1950?&amp;nbsp; By what criterion?&amp;nbsp; If Moore&#39;s Law is not our benchmark of a successful civilization - what is?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sam Altman has his answer.&amp;nbsp; The hedonic treadmill!&amp;nbsp; Never having sold a startup for $40 mil, there are many subtle, refined and delicious forms of hedonism of which I am as innocent as a cat of tennis.&amp;nbsp; But allowing (for a moment) this implicit assumption that the purpose of civilization is the &lt;i&gt;satisfaction of human desires&lt;/i&gt;, we can refer only to &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Maslow&#39;s pyramid of needs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the base of the pyramid are air, water and food.&amp;nbsp; How does 2013 do at supplying oxygen, hydration and nutrition?&amp;nbsp; How did 1950 do?&amp;nbsp; Just fine.&amp;nbsp; Gentlemen, a draw.&amp;nbsp; (The food of 2013 is certainly &lt;i&gt;tastier&lt;/i&gt; than that of 1950, at least in America.&amp;nbsp; But this is not the base of the pyramid.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next up: safety and security.&amp;nbsp; All right, gentlemen.&amp;nbsp; Let&#39;s have another thought-experiment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Picture the Earth - our beautiful, blue, spinning globe.&amp;nbsp; Take all the habitable land area and color it white - as a neutral background for our thought experiment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, select the subset of this beautiful planet on which a sober, sensible, civilized person, such as Sam Altman, would consider it prudent and safe to wander, &lt;a href=&quot;http://books.google.com/books?id=1iEiAAAAMAAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA481&amp;amp;lpg=PA481&amp;amp;dq=luke+owen+pike+on+foot+and+alone&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=FTElxDwO_o&amp;amp;sig=rldp7D6O6fBNUp_gfvEGyD-V3YQ&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ei=kek9UZKVGsGzyQGRt4HADQ&amp;amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=luke%20owen%20pike%20on%20foot%20and%20alone&amp;amp;f=false&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&quot;on foot and alone,&quot;&lt;/a&gt; carrying his iPad, at night.&amp;nbsp; Leave that part white.&amp;nbsp; Color the other part brown.&amp;nbsp; Then, from the brown subset, select the further subset in which Sam Altman, carrying his iPad, would not consider it prudent and safe to wander &lt;i&gt;in the daytime&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Color that part &lt;i&gt;black&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; (Why can&#39;t Google Maps do this?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then do the same for Sam Altman&#39;s grandfather, in 1950, with his portable Smith-Corona.&amp;nbsp; Then, repeat the exercise for 1900.&amp;nbsp; (Part of the reason this is such a useful mental exercise, and unfortunately such a difficult one, is that it requires you to actually &lt;i&gt;know&lt;/i&gt; what the world was like in 1950 or 1900.&amp;nbsp; If your way of getting this information starts with statistical tables, ur doin it rong.&amp;nbsp; There are these things called &quot;books&quot; which will help you out.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you perform this exercise accurately, or at least if you get the same results as me, you&#39;ll see a 20C quite indistinguishable from Stage III melanoma.&amp;nbsp; And this progress continues, to rousing applause and general self-congratulation, right up into our own dear official NYT-approved 2013.&amp;nbsp; Hey, been to Egypt lately?&amp;nbsp; What&#39;s that Google guy up to these days?&amp;nbsp; Is he still tweeting?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of Twitter, I experience this reality check in person every day.&amp;nbsp; My daughter&#39;s preschool is at 10th and Howard, two blocks from Twitter HQ.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s actually not too hard to park at 10th and Howard.&amp;nbsp; So the average number of what Sibyl calls &quot;dangerous persons,&quot; and to an ordinary grownup are basically indistinguishable from zombies, that I and my bubbly daughter have to navigate around between the car door and the security guard is... I don&#39;t know... 1.3?&amp;nbsp; 1.7?&amp;nbsp; It can&#39;t be much more than 2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#39;re just zombies and really they&#39;re not that dangerous.&amp;nbsp; (I think even zombies can sense that when I&#39;m with a child, I am more dangerous to them than the converse.)&amp;nbsp; On the other hand, a couple months ago a techie (not a Twitter employee) was hit on the head and killed, presumably by zombie or zombies unknown, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfgate.com/crime/article/SoMa-assault-victim-dies-4229551.php&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;at 11th and Mission&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Right around the corner from Tweet Central.&amp;nbsp; Besides a couple of perfunctory boilerplate stories, and of course the victim&#39;s wife, no one noticed.&amp;nbsp; No one cared.&amp;nbsp; Why would they?&amp;nbsp; Their iPads have &lt;i&gt;4.7 million pixels&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suffice it to say that if you don&#39;t know how 1950 would have reacted to exactly the same event, in exactly the same place, you don&#39;t know anything about 1950.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually, my daughter&#39;s preschool is &lt;i&gt;literally in a ruin&lt;/i&gt; - that is, a (nicely renovated) space which used to be part of a Catholic church.&amp;nbsp; (The preschool is the former convent.&amp;nbsp; The rest of the church remains a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WM5QC2_St_Josephs_Church_and_Complex_San_Francisco_CA&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ruin&lt;/a&gt; proper.)&amp;nbsp; Where are the people who used to pray in this church?&amp;nbsp; They &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_flight&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;fled&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Why?&amp;nbsp; Because they were &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_cleansing&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;afraid for their physical safety&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know, I know.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.phillymag.com/articles/white-philly/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;gauche&lt;/a&gt; to even bring this kind of stuff up.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s not part of our consensus reality.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s not part of our consensus &lt;i&gt;history&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; When it comes to &lt;i&gt;actual&lt;/i&gt; history, however, the global decline of security in the second half of the 20th century is (I assert) the salient phenomenon of our era.&amp;nbsp; Much as the fall of the Roman Empire is the salient phenomenon of 4th-century AD Europe.&amp;nbsp; (Note that while our historians would desperately love to find one, just one, member of the exquisitely literate 4th-century AD European culture who would even &lt;i&gt;mention&lt;/i&gt; that the Roman Empire was falling apart, no such luck.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s all wall-to-wall Prudentius and Sidonius.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Consider our alien in Alpha Centauri.&amp;nbsp; His telescope is just a telescope.&amp;nbsp; He no speaka the English. &amp;nbsp; He is absolutely invulnerable to our most respected propaganda authorities and in particular has no way to read the great Harvard scholar Steven Pinker - truly a Prudentius for our age - who has discovered through elaborate statistical models that the 20C was not, in fact, the golden age of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Book_of_Communism&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;titanic mass murder&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.priceonomics.com/post/43688725792/how-do-you-steal-a-bike-asking-for-a-friend&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;brazen petty crime&lt;/a&gt;, but the dawning of a new age of Aquarius in which all will have peace and prosperity.&amp;nbsp; (Even Pinker is a piker next to the Times, which has published at least 547 stories about NYC&#39;s miraculous conquest of its &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/29/nyregion/new-york-police-department-manipulates-crime-reports-study-finds.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;blatantly managed&lt;/a&gt; crime statistics, and precisely 2 about the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/28/nyregion/28crime.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;hospital statistics&lt;/a&gt; which show a parallel doubling in actual assault victims.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s always so easy to lie to those who want to be lied to - you hardly even &lt;i&gt;need&lt;/i&gt; statistics.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But his is an excellent telescope. So our alien can &lt;i&gt;see&lt;/i&gt; the fact that many parts of all, and all parts of some, American cities that were thriving in 1950, have now fallen into chaos and ruin.&amp;nbsp; On the other hand, he can gaze admiringly at the thriving cafes of University Avenue in Palo Alto, Ausonius&#39; &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.org/stream/deciausonius01ausouoft#page/n5/mode/2up&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Moselle&lt;/a&gt; born anew, full of beautiful young people adoring the perfectly antialiased individual subpixels of their new Retina iPads.&amp;nbsp; Which of these phenomena will he find more relevant?&amp;nbsp; Which is the narrative, which the distraction?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Continuing the comparison to the fall of Rome, one of the interesting features we see is that while technological competence is certainly an indicator of a successful civilization, it is also a &lt;i&gt;lagging&lt;/i&gt; indicator. Civilization produces technology, not the other way around.&amp;nbsp; When civilization falls, technology is not the first but the last thing to fall.&amp;nbsp; Yes, technology does decline in the fall of Rome.&amp;nbsp; No, it has not declined in our era - though its advance has certainly slowed a great deal.&amp;nbsp; But the centuries of European technology decline are 400-700 AD, a point at which surely any historian would admit that the Roman polity has already been going to the dogs for two centuries minimum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Am I too hard on Sam Altman?&amp;nbsp; After all, he admits there&#39;s a problem.&amp;nbsp; He doesn&#39;t admit &lt;i&gt;this&lt;/i&gt; problem - but isn&#39;t his point basically the same?&amp;nbsp; That something isn&#39;t working?&amp;nbsp; My America is going to the dogs and lies in ruins all around me.&amp;nbsp; His America has just turned the friction up too high on its hedonic treadmill.&amp;nbsp; But it&#39;s the same, isn&#39;t it?&amp;nbsp; Sort of?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Realizing that something in the 20th-century model of governance, as taught by the best and brightest of Harvard, Stanford, the NYT and other fine institutions of papally infallible veracity, isn&#39;t working out &lt;i&gt;quite right&lt;/i&gt;, is indeed a step in the right direction.&amp;nbsp; Everybody&#39;s going to have their own particular beef.&amp;nbsp; Mine, as we&#39;ve seen, is that 75 years of this rigorously scientific system of government has reduced what was once America&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUbsw28PCpA&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;fourth-largest city&lt;/a&gt; to a &lt;span id=&quot;goog_407243654&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWEdjiEJg0U&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;demon-haunted slum&lt;span id=&quot;goog_407243655&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - and while extreme, this outcome is anything but an exception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But so far as I can tell, from the Sam Altman perspective, this is just a nitpick.&amp;nbsp; Or maybe it&#39;s really sad, but would have happened to any regime.&amp;nbsp; Napoleon, Cato the Elder, Pericles, Peter the Great - morons!&amp;nbsp; None of them could have done a damned thing to save Detroit, Oakland, Baltimore, etc.&amp;nbsp; Not where Harvard failed! It&#39;s always easy to attribute bad outcomes to irresistible forces of nature, acts of God, etc.&amp;nbsp; Even if you can&#39;t identify the force of nature and you don&#39;t believe in God.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No - Sam Altman is concerned with something entirely different.&amp;nbsp; He is concerned with a &lt;i&gt;number&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; This number is about 2, he asserts, when it should be more like 5.&amp;nbsp; He calls this number &quot;growth.&quot;&amp;nbsp; Or to be more exact, an even more interesting number, &quot;real growth.&quot;&amp;nbsp; Growth is of course a good thing, especially if you&#39;re a startup but unless you&#39;re a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.quotationspage.com/quote/33191.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;tumor&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once again, this remarkable number - &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;GDP growth&lt;/a&gt; - is an essential part of the 20C tradition of economic governance.&amp;nbsp; Where would we be without &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abba_P._Lerner&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Abba Lerner&lt;/a&gt;?&amp;nbsp; Well, I don&#39;t know.&amp;nbsp; Where would Detroit be without Abba Lerner?&amp;nbsp; Where was Detroit... before Abba Lerner?&amp;nbsp; Perhaps the problem with Sam Altman is just that everything he knows about economics he learned at Stanford, whereas everything I know about economics I learned by watching &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardcore_Pawn&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Hardcore Pawn&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What does this number actually mean?&amp;nbsp; It clearly means &lt;i&gt;something&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; We know it goes up when people are happy, generally, and down when they are sad.&amp;nbsp; Perhaps the great historical puzzle of the 20C is the need to explain this strange phenomenon, broadly defined, of Keynesian economics - which on the one hand seems to &lt;a href=&quot;http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/04/14/time-for-bottles-in-coal-mines/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;make no sense at all&lt;/a&gt;, but on the other hand seems to, kind of, work.&amp;nbsp; At least on a local level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, okay, I lied.&amp;nbsp; Yes - Hardcore Pawn is very important to me.&amp;nbsp; But really I&#39;m a mercantilist, and everything I know about economics I learned by reading &lt;a href=&quot;http://books.google.com/books?id=4uuc7tdk0Z8C&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Friedrich List&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Well, him and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_von_Mises&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mises&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Odd bedfellows I know.&amp;nbsp; But I really believe there is nothing in (to use its old name) political economy which is outside the philosophy of these two fine Teutonic gentlemen, opposites though they were.&amp;nbsp; Please allow me to explain &quot;growth&quot; in this unusual Austro-mercantilist idiom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Growth is the change in a number called &quot;GDP.&quot;&amp;nbsp; To an Austro-mercantilist there are two kinds of GDP, which we call AGDP (actual GDP, ie, an actually measured number) and FGDP (fudged GDP, which is AGDP multiplied by a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP_deflator&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;mysterious fudge factor&lt;/a&gt;).&amp;nbsp; With its usual fine subtle sense of irony, 20C economics calls AGDP &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nominal_income_target&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&quot;nominal GDP&quot;&lt;/a&gt; and FGDP &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_gross_domestic_product#Relationship_with_nominal_GDP&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&quot;real GDP.&quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;20C economics is especially adept at accounting identities.&amp;nbsp; The late great Murray Rothbard once parodied one of its finest absurdities, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_of_exchange&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;equation of exchange&lt;/a&gt;, as: &quot;the amount of water that runs off the ground is the same as the amount of rain that falls from the sky.&quot;&amp;nbsp; Which is true.&amp;nbsp; But not particularly useful to the weather forecaster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So let&#39;s apply one of these identities to understand AGDP.&amp;nbsp; Forget foreign trade, which we&#39;ll add back in in a sec, and consider an isolated unit like a planet.&amp;nbsp; How do we measure the economic production of the planet?&amp;nbsp; We arbitrarily divide economic actors, with some difficulty but not too much, into &quot;consumers&quot; and &quot;producers&quot; - ie, peasants and businesses.&amp;nbsp; AGDP is simply the total sales of all businesses to all peasants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ie, if all businesses were One Giant Business - you can see the attraction of this approach to the mid-20C central planner, snorting boa-thick lines of pure administrative Bolivian as he plays SimCity with real peasants - AGDP is simply the gross revenues of this monster.&amp;nbsp; And because the amount of water that runs off the ground is the same as the amount of rain that falls from the sky, AGDP is also the number of dollars that consumers spent this year at OGB.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this approach because it reduces the veiled mystery of &quot;growth&quot; to a crass urban reality that everyone can understand.&amp;nbsp; What does &quot;growth&quot; mean?&amp;nbsp; It means: &quot;spend more, comrades!&quot;&amp;nbsp; If growth is good by definition, spending is good by definition.&amp;nbsp; Because the amount of water that runs off the ground is the same as the amount of rain that falls from the sky.&amp;nbsp; Aggregate demand is your friend.&amp;nbsp; Spend more, comrades!&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s good for the economy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How do you increase AGDP?&amp;nbsp; There are two and only two ways.&amp;nbsp; One, give the peasants more dollars (and/or reduce their debt).&amp;nbsp; Two, make them less thrifty and more prodigal.&amp;nbsp; Why is AGDP not increasing fast enough for the likes of Sam Altman?&amp;nbsp; Or for that matter, Paul Krugman?&amp;nbsp; Because both these levers are already pushed down to the floor.&amp;nbsp; Or at least the second one is.&amp;nbsp; The first one... we&#39;ll get there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But wait - why increase AGDP?&amp;nbsp; Why is more spending inherently better than less spending?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two answers to this question, corresponding to your understanding of the purpose of an economy.&amp;nbsp; The first is the false position held by Austrians, and by Keynesians when they want to confuse you: the belief that the purpose of economic activity is the satisfaction of human desires.&amp;nbsp; More spending means more production, and more production means more satisfaction.&amp;nbsp; This perspective, of course, originates with 18th- and 19th-century liberals and utilitarians.&amp;nbsp; You can see it all over Sam Altman&#39;s hedonic treadmill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This false position leads us down the path of FGDP.&amp;nbsp; Let&#39;s explore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why the fudge factor?&amp;nbsp; Because our goal is not to merely assess the &lt;i&gt;price&lt;/i&gt; of all goods produced, a mere number which can be measured by mundane if fallible techniques, and still worse can actually be &lt;i&gt;defined&lt;/i&gt; - but their &lt;i&gt;value&lt;/i&gt;, that is, &lt;i&gt;hedonic utility&lt;/i&gt;. This is an almost spiritual and essentially qualitative and personal assessment.&amp;nbsp; In usual 20C style, we damn the torpedoes and jam this subjective quality into an objective quantity by any means necessary.&amp;nbsp; Otherwise, how would we model it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For example: how much more fun of a computer is an iPad than an Apple II?&amp;nbsp; Is it 37.6 times more fun?&amp;nbsp; Or 198.2 times more fun?&amp;nbsp; Or even 547.9?&amp;nbsp; It would seem clear, to anyone not a blithering idiot, that any process which claims to be able to derive any such number is retarded at best and may well constitute felony math abuse. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not at all!&amp;nbsp; The Bureau of Labor Statistics is, in fact, in possession of exactly this figure.&amp;nbsp; Here&#39;s how they do it.&amp;nbsp; Since Apple was selling computers continuously from Apple II to iPad, we can look at the period when both the Apple II and Apple III were on sale, divide the list price of the Apple III by the Apple II; later, the Mac 512K by the Apple III, and so on until we reach the iPad.&amp;nbsp; This process is called &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_regression&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;hedonic regression&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; It is thoroughly official - approved of by both Harvard and the US Government.&amp;nbsp; So who&#39;s the blithering idiot now?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#39;s especially awesome is to imagine a world with a sane financial system in which the quantity of money (perhaps Bitcoin) is fixed, and so are the time preferences of consumers.&amp;nbsp; As a result, AGDP does not change.&amp;nbsp; AGDP growth is &lt;i&gt;zero by definition&lt;/i&gt; in this model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But in such a world, nothing prevents the hedonic quality of technology from increasing.&amp;nbsp; Computers can get better.&amp;nbsp; Indeed they should.&amp;nbsp; And FGDP can increase - though all FGDP increases are due to the GDP deflator, ie, hedonic fudge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, consider the logical situation of the Altman position (also held, I think, by Peter Thiel - and certainly not uncommon among otherwise sensible thinkers) in this constant-money, constant AGDP model.&amp;nbsp; The argument is that we want &quot;real&quot; (FGDP) rather than &quot;inflationary&quot; (AGDP) economic growth, and the only path to this &quot;real&quot; growth is technology advancement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;True enough!&amp;nbsp; In fact, it&#39;s so true that it&#39;s... a tautology.&amp;nbsp; With constant AGDP, we&#39;ve removed all the variables from the equation.&amp;nbsp; Oops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When AGDP inflation, which none of these technology prophets wants to talk about, falls out of the equation, the argument that &quot;we need technical progress to spur growth&quot; turns into... simply the hedonic treadmill.&amp;nbsp; It expands to &quot;2013 isn&#39;t fun enough, so let&#39;s get more and better technology to make 2014 more fun than 2013, because otherwise our fun sensors are all burned out and 2014 will be boo-oring.&quot; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, sure!&amp;nbsp; I, for instance, am seriously confused about why everyone in 2013 is still wearing headphones with wires.&amp;nbsp; What&#39;s with Bluetooth A2DP?&amp;nbsp; Doesn&#39;t it work?&amp;nbsp; And definitely, they should speed it up with that Google Glass thing.&amp;nbsp; If that ain&#39;t hedonic I don&#39;t know what is.&amp;nbsp; Especially when it comes to pr0n.&amp;nbsp; Certainly the BLS is falling down on the job if pr0n isn&#39;t part of their GDP deflator.&amp;nbsp; OMG, pr0n - what could be more hedonic than pr0n?&amp;nbsp; Google Glass + pr0n - that&#39;s what.&amp;nbsp; As Glenn Reynolds puts it: faster, please!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, you know, this &quot;2013 isn&#39;t fun enough&quot; argument really doesn&#39;t tell us anything at all about why Detroit is a ruin.&amp;nbsp; It doesn&#39;t tell us why Baltimore is a ruin.&amp;nbsp; It doesn&#39;t tell us why Oakland is a ruin.&amp;nbsp; It doesn&#39;t tell us why Stockton is sinking into the Sacramento River, or why Newark could absorb all of Mark Zuckerberg&#39;s personal net worth without becoming anything at all like Cherry Hill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#39;s happened here is that, starting with an absurdity, we have reasoned ourselves into nonsense.&amp;nbsp; Or at least, into pr0n.&amp;nbsp; Our premise was that the purpose of economic activity is hedonism, ie, the satisfaction of human desires.&amp;nbsp; Certainly, technology can satisfy human desires.&amp;nbsp; Pr0n can too, and so can heroin.&amp;nbsp; (In fact, it would be interesting if the BLS could determine which is more hedonic: the original iPad, plus heroin, or the Retina with 4.7 million pixels and maybe just a little codeine to take the edge off.&amp;nbsp; This could be computed easily, and with impeccable quantitative rigor, by combining Apple price series with the latest data from Silk Road.) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This absurdity happens to be the consensus reality.&amp;nbsp; Yet it is no less absurd.&amp;nbsp; Let&#39;s put on our John Carpenter sunglasses and look at the &lt;i&gt;real&lt;/i&gt; reality, terrifying though it is.&amp;nbsp; Surely if you can read all the way down in a post this long, you can handle the real reality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In actual reality, we are trying to answer the question: how should America be governed?&amp;nbsp; We are therefore reasoning from the perspective of the State.&amp;nbsp; Since sovereignty is conserved, the State is always and everywhere absolute and omnipotent.&amp;nbsp; Therefore, the hedonic satisfaction of its citizens, who are in fact its slaves, is not and cannot be a goal.&amp;nbsp; It may be a means to an end, of course.&amp;nbsp; As when we administer heroin through the barracks water supply to reward Camp #127 for exceeding its uranium production targets three months in a row.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, see.&amp;nbsp; I told you reality was scary.&amp;nbsp; I don&#39;t actually believe absolute government, which is always and everywhere the reality, implies totalitarian government.&amp;nbsp; USG is an absolute government as well.&amp;nbsp; I am not a big USG fan. &amp;nbsp; But I don&#39;t seem to find myself in the uranium mines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In general, the classic 20C phenomena of totalitarianism appears not in absolute governments that are secure and invulnerable, but in extremely weak ones that in consequence have to take extraordinary measures to repress their enemies.&amp;nbsp; This (among other things) is the difference between Louis XIV and Stalin.&amp;nbsp; USG&#39;s great virtue is that its monopoly of power is far more secure than Louis XIV&#39;s, so it doesn&#39;t have to give a damn what I post on my stupid blog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if we are analyzing real governments in the real world, our financial analysis has to be rooted in political reality.&amp;nbsp; The political reality is that &quot;citizens&quot; are not owners of their government, but rather assets - in other words, slaves.&amp;nbsp; Our only hope is for a regime that&#39;s more Thomas Jefferson and less Simon Legree.&amp;nbsp; Fortunately, as we&#39;ll see, this analysis aligns the financial interests of the State with our own interests as human beings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What are the financial interests of the absolute State?&amp;nbsp; To maximize the value of its productive assets.&amp;nbsp; The State&#39;s assets are (a) land and buildings, (b) equipment, and (c) human chattel.&amp;nbsp; We understand how to value and manage (a) and (b) just fine.&amp;nbsp; But most of its equity consists of (c) - an asset not really taught in most business schools.&amp;nbsp; (Fortunately you still have those yellow old stacks of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Bow%27s_Review&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;DeBow&#39;s Review&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is another way to ask whether, excluding advances in technology (which do fall under (c), since technology is a human ability - but hard to monopolize), America is a more valuable nation in 2013 than it was in 1950.&amp;nbsp; We can ask: is the average American a better human being than his or her ancestors of 1950?&amp;nbsp; Ie: has the USG cultivated its human capital, or wasted it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For example: is this person - this asset, this slave - a harder worker?&amp;nbsp; We&#39;ll assume the State cannot change his IQ, because I have seen no evidence that it can - but is he more knowledgeable?&amp;nbsp; Is he more moral, more physically healthy, wiser and more prudent?&amp;nbsp; A better father, a better mother?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, I believe the answer is obvious.&amp;nbsp; There are certainly some ways in which the average American of 2013 is a better person than his grandfather.&amp;nbsp; He is probably a better feminist, for instance.&amp;nbsp; He is much less likely to be an anti-Semite, homophobe, etc.&amp;nbsp; These factors don&#39;t really affect his economic value, but perhaps they&#39;re worth mentioning anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, the American of 2013 is &lt;i&gt;much&lt;/i&gt; more likely to be a meth-head, a thug or ho, a worthless trustafarian slacker, etc, etc, etc.&amp;nbsp; Especially when we look at non-elite ethnic subpopulations - &quot;cracker&quot; Scots-Irish, African Americans, etc (though if we listen to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/the-myth-of-american-meritocracy/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ron Unz&lt;/a&gt;, even the Jews are going to the dogs),&amp;nbsp; I don&#39;t think any serious person could really claim that the average American is superior as a human being to his grandparents.&amp;nbsp; You might as well assert that the original iPad was teh greatness but this Retina crap they&#39;re making these days is just lame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#39;s notable about this interpretation is that, again, your interests and your government&#39;s are just about perfectly aligned.&amp;nbsp; You don&#39;t want to be a heroin addict.&amp;nbsp; Washington doesn&#39;t want its slaves to be heroin addicts.&amp;nbsp; You want to be a better person - more informed, more reliable, more capable.&amp;nbsp; As a better person, you are a better and more valuable capital asset.&amp;nbsp; You augment your government&#39;s market cap.&amp;nbsp; Back to Sam Altman:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;Most of us want our lives to get better every year—the hedonic treadmill is a pain that way.&lt;/blockquote&gt;As &quot;hedonic&quot; implies, &quot;better&quot; means &quot;more fun.&quot;&amp;nbsp; Obviously this is the attitude you&#39;d expect from someone born in the Bush administration.&amp;nbsp; Could it be any other way?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Us old Nixon fogeys have pretty much exhausted the hedonic treadmill.&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s not much left of your hedonic treadmill after the 17th time cleaning up baby hork in the middle of the night.&amp;nbsp; At that point (yes, new parents, it &lt;i&gt;does&lt;/i&gt; get better) a nice glass of wine and a dinner out with your wife is more or less the hedonic equivalent of a meth-fueled threeway with strippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of &lt;i&gt;us&lt;/i&gt; want to become better people every year.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;re pretty confident, perhaps falsely, that this will lead to more hedonic rewards in the long run or at least has the best chance of doing so.&amp;nbsp; But this isn&#39;t the goal.&amp;nbsp; The goal, believe it or not, is to become better people.&amp;nbsp; And ideally our children will be even better than us.&amp;nbsp; So again - the market cap goes up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything I&#39;m saying here (including the economics) was said by Carlyle more than 150 years ago, notably in &lt;a href=&quot;http://books.google.com/books/about/Chartism.html?id=kaelVuyDq20C&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Chartism&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; The apotheosis of the hedonic principle is the immortal &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://books.google.com/books?id=5OsNAQAAMAAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA315#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Pig-Philosophy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Briefly, Carlyle tells us, the difference between man and beast is that maximization of hedonic utility is always and everywhere the method of a beast.&amp;nbsp; Not coincidentally, it is also the method of a toddler.&amp;nbsp; And it is also the method of the Austrian economist, although he at least realizes that the &quot;utility function&quot; is qualitative and subjective rather than quantitative and objective, and adds &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_preference&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;time preference&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To Mises and Rothbard, the human being as economic actor is a very smart pig, often willing to exchange less slop today for more slop tomorrow.&amp;nbsp; This is not at all the view of Carlyle - nor is it the view of List.&amp;nbsp; Of course, from the economic perspective of the State, slop production is all that matters.&amp;nbsp; But the human being is not only an economic actor - nor is the State only an agency of production.&amp;nbsp; What we&#39;d really like to see is a model in which there is no tension between Pig-Philosophy (which must be acknowledged as true) and actual human civilization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are now in a position to attack the mystery of &quot;growth.&quot;&amp;nbsp; Why, if economic hedonism is such a shallow and easily debunked philosophy, do so many people take &quot;growth&quot; so seriously?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All subterfuges and evasions to the contrary, the basic economic problem faced by 20th-century governments (somewhat less in the 19C; far more in the 21C) is unemployment.&amp;nbsp; The cause of unemployment is simple: in an industrial economy, most human beings are economically useless.&amp;nbsp; They are not productive assets at all.&amp;nbsp; They are liabilities.&amp;nbsp; For a brief transitional period, they could still be used as industrial robots.&amp;nbsp; This period is close to its end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For instance, suppose a Sam Altman were given plenary power over the US economy, reorganized into One Giant Business.&amp;nbsp; His mission: cut costs, while maintaining production.&amp;nbsp; His methods: eliminate white-collar busywork (real estate agents, lawyers, medical billing clerks, etc); replace human industrial robots with actual industrial robots; and when all else fails, replace high-cost American labor with low-cost Indians housed in barracks and fed only on lentils, Dubai style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does anyone doubt that aggressive and autocratic application of these methods could reduce US employment by 5 to 10 percent a year for at least a decade?&amp;nbsp; Indeed, as the Singularity nears, the future of work becomes clear - there is an IQ threshold below which any human, no matter how cheap to feed, is a liability.&amp;nbsp; Classic unskilled manual labor remains productive in some domains - gardening, housecleaning, and so on.&amp;nbsp; Perhaps this will be true for another decade or two.&amp;nbsp; It will not be true indefinitely.&amp;nbsp; As the machines get smarter - assuming they get smarter - the threshold will rise.&amp;nbsp; Eventually, the only human beings worth employing will be Sam Altman and his friends.&amp;nbsp; Then, at last, even they will be laid off.&amp;nbsp; Universal unemployment is the definition of the Singularity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, it&#39;s important to note that from a strictly &lt;i&gt;economic&lt;/i&gt; perspective, there is no problem here at all.&amp;nbsp; The absolute State as Pig-Philosopher has a simple answer.&amp;nbsp; As Stalin put it - no person, no problem.&amp;nbsp; These surplus human robots can simply be sacrificed, like worn-out lab mice.&amp;nbsp; At this point they stop being liabilities and become assets again, since they can be sold as organs or at least organ meats.&amp;nbsp; Certainly, when the State itself becomes a computer, this logic will be irresistible.&amp;nbsp; Let&#39;s call this approach to human liabilities Solution A.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From a &lt;i&gt;political&lt;/i&gt; perspective, Solution A is a nonstarter.&amp;nbsp; Hopefully it will always remain a nonstarter.&amp;nbsp; If we are entirely wedded to Pig-Philosophy, we can explain this by saying that sacrificing human liabilities (especially within earshot) actually damages the capital value of the non-sacrificed pigs, because it terrifies and demoralizes them.&amp;nbsp; But is this true?&amp;nbsp; Might it not motivate them, instead?&amp;nbsp; Whatever.&amp;nbsp; There are more things in my philosophy than pigs, and yours too as well, and while I am quite willing to take a King I draw the line at a Computer-King - especially if the Computer-King is programmed entirely with Pig-Philosophy.&amp;nbsp; Since I am more tolerant in this regard than most, I just don&#39;t see Solution A happening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We move on to Solution B, which I think is the solution most people believe in.&amp;nbsp; Work?&amp;nbsp; Who the hell wants to work?&amp;nbsp; Work is anti-hedonic by definition.&amp;nbsp; If it didn&#39;t have negative utility, it wouldn&#39;t be work.&amp;nbsp; So, it&#39;s supposed to be a problem that in the future, work will be obsolete, and we&#39;ll be able to produce goods and services without any human labor at all?&amp;nbsp; That doesn&#39;t sound like a problem to me.&amp;nbsp; It sounds like a victory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem with Solution B is that we&#39;ve already tried it, quite extensively.&amp;nbsp; You see Solution B every time you go to the grocery store.&amp;nbsp; Next to the button marked &quot;Debit/Credit&quot; is one marked &quot;EBT.&quot;&amp;nbsp; Ever pressed that one?&amp;nbsp; Even just by mistake?&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s the Solution B button.&amp;nbsp; America has entire cities that have moved beyond anti-hedonic labor disutility and entered the gleaming future of Solution B.&amp;nbsp; One of them is called &quot;Detroit.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Solution B is not the culmination of human civilization, it turns out, but its destruction.&amp;nbsp; Even in terms of mere Pig-Philosophy, it is destructive, because it ruins a human asset.&amp;nbsp; If we appraise humans as robots, we see that this is a special kind of robot: it rusts up if not continually operating.&amp;nbsp; As beasts, we are beasts who evolved to work.&amp;nbsp; Our species achieved world domination as a result of our capacity for work.&amp;nbsp; To feed and entertain a human being, without requiring productive effort or at least some simulation of it, is in the end just a way to destroy him - not too different from Solution A.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some human beings, Sam Altman presumably among them, who are natural aristocrats.&amp;nbsp; They can acquire the resources they would need to never work again, and &lt;i&gt;still continue to work&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; While this is lovely, we need to face the reality that the human species is what it is.&amp;nbsp; The population does not consist largely or even significantly of natural aristocrats.&amp;nbsp; Not, for instance, in Detroit. &quot;Dead corpses, the rotting body of a brother man, whom fate or unjust men have killed, this is not a pleasant spectacle; but what say you to the dead soul of a man, -- in a body which still pretends to be vigorously alive, and &lt;i&gt;can drink rum?&lt;/i&gt;&quot;&amp;nbsp; Carlyle knew all about Hardcore Pawn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beyond the creepy A and B, all solutions to the problem involve a State which compels, through economic or other means (it hardly matters), humans who are not economically productive to submit to work or some simulation thereof.&amp;nbsp; For instance, especially with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oculus_Rift&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Oculus Rift&lt;/a&gt;, technology is beginning to present us with a Solution C, which combines physical imprisonment with virtual enrichment.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s not clear what a life-scale virtual environment would consist of, but it would surely involve work or something like it.&amp;nbsp; I don&#39;t find Solution C particularly creepy, but I may be alone in this.&amp;nbsp; It is certainly less creepy than A or B.&amp;nbsp; I suspect that if it was done right, the customers would vastly prefer it to their present vile circumstances.&amp;nbsp; But I also suspect it will never happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beyond A, B, and C, we enter the domain of solutions which involve distorting labor markets to integrate these human liabilities into some semblance of a normal institution of production.&amp;nbsp; Solution D is the obvious approach and has been practiced by regimes around the world since Cheops was a little boy: to keep the peasants fit, healthy and happy, pay them to do otherwise unnecessary work.&amp;nbsp; Like, you know, building pyramids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is an apocryphal anecdote which illustrates Solution D perfectly.&amp;nbsp; It probably never happened. A famous American economist - Milton Friedman, perhaps - is visiting China, perhaps in the &#39;80s, and sees a construction project where workers are digging a canal, with picks and shovels.&amp;nbsp; &quot;Why not use bulldozers?&quot; the economist suggests.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;But Professor Friedman,&quot; his host points out, &quot;this is a jobs project.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Oh!&quot; says the apocryphal professor.&amp;nbsp; &quot;Well, in that case, why are they using picks?&amp;nbsp; Why not give them spoons?&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this is meant to illustrate the supposed idiocy of Solution D, it actually illustrates the design space.&amp;nbsp; The purpose of Solution D is to lose as little money as possible, while maintaining the human quality of your assets and preventing them from degenerating into Hardcore Pawn customers, 10th St. zombies or other revolting parodies of the human condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Digging ditches with appropriate hand tools is a simple and almost ennobling, in its own small way, form of manual labor which is ideally suited to the condition of most humans, delicate aristocrats perhaps excepted.&amp;nbsp; (It is possible to construct makework for &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_One&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;delicate aristocrats&lt;/a&gt;, but it takes more imagination.)&amp;nbsp; Digging ditches with spoons is a degrading punishment appropriate only for refractory pedophiles.&amp;nbsp; Since there is never any shortage of ditches you&#39;d rather have than not, there is no need to issue spoons - unless the purpose of the project is exemplary degradation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what&#39;s the problem?&amp;nbsp; Why isn&#39;t USG sending its millions of gangstaz, its hundreds of thousands of zombies, and its uncountable hordes of ordinary young people who just can&#39;t find a damn job, to self-improvement-through-labor facilities where they create &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gates_of_the_Arctic_National_Park&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;gleaming new national parks&lt;/a&gt;, which no one ever visits, on the North Slope of Alaska?&amp;nbsp; It might seem illiberal, but it can&#39;t be - &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilian_Conservation_Corps&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;FDR did it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In general, makework programs are restricted to strong governments.&amp;nbsp; Ours is a large government, but by no means a strong one.&amp;nbsp; FDR&#39;s was a strong one.&amp;nbsp; When a strong government wants to &quot;create jobs,&quot; it just hires people.&amp;nbsp; If the product is useless and the work is just makework, it says so.&amp;nbsp; The strong are confident and can tell the truth.&amp;nbsp; A weak government has to shroud the truth in a cloak of lies - it has to convincingly pretend that our great nation may be doomed without substantial and immediate improvements to &quot;Gates of the Arctic National Park.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oddly, makework, a superior solution by any standard, is a softer political target than good old Solution B welfare.&amp;nbsp; Makework has to be defended by lies, whereas welfare is indefensible.&amp;nbsp; The defenders of welfare are therefore forced into the brazen fortress of property - they and their clients must assert that they are &lt;i&gt;entitled&lt;/i&gt; to these emoluments, which is of course the one thing they ain&#39;t.&amp;nbsp; But, having established adverse possession, they make a pretty good go of retaining it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Politically, the ideal way to apply Solution D is to make the actual work as separate as possible from the source of funding.&amp;nbsp; This brings us back to AGDP and &quot;growth.&quot;&amp;nbsp; (You didn&#39;t think we were &lt;i&gt;digressing&lt;/i&gt;, did you?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Politically, the best way to fund and operate makework is to make it indistinguishable from the rest of the economy.&amp;nbsp; If you tax productive citizens $1T a year to employ 10 million Americans to build, with hand tools, a 1:1 copy of Rome at the base of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Igikpak&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mount Igikpak&lt;/a&gt;, you create a giant political target for stupid unruly peasants who persist in not understanding the genius of Lord Keynes.&amp;nbsp; If instead, you manage to inflate aggregate consumer spending by $1T, you create ordinary jobs for ordinary Americans all across America - because where does that $1T go?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of it winds up as profit, of course - but most of it goes into the costs of production, ie, labor costs.&amp;nbsp; Ie, creating jobs.&amp;nbsp; The love is spread all over the country as a delicious buttery layer of prosperity.&amp;nbsp; No one votes against prosperity.&amp;nbsp; Ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, you&#39;re still annoying the people you tax.&amp;nbsp; Nor is it possible to pump tax money directly into consumer spending.&amp;nbsp; It has to go through government spending instead.&amp;nbsp; This makes two targets: the taxation and the spending.&amp;nbsp; It can be managed.&amp;nbsp; But it also can be improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suppose you borrow instead of taxing?&amp;nbsp; This is better because no one feels the bite.&amp;nbsp; However, government borrowing - which, as we&#39;ve discovered, is identical in every way to mere &quot;money printing,&quot; ie, equity issuance, since fiat currency is government equity and there is no real accounting distinction between Fed and Treasury, or between Fed notes and Treasury obligations - still has a downside.&amp;nbsp; The downside is that it&#39;s reported and has to appear in the newspapers - alarming the stupid peasants who persist in not understanding the genius of Lord Keynes, instead believing that Washington has to pay back its debts as though it was some stupid peasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moreover, even the most dedicated bureaucrat who is more Keynesian than Keynes himself feels a slight sense of alarm about the indiscriminate use of this privilege, because somewhere in the back of his reptile brain he understands what he is doing: imposing a stealth capital levy on the wealthy, by diluting the dollar supply.&amp;nbsp; Suppose dollar holders evaded this tax, which after all is a tax, by switching to some other monetary asset?&amp;nbsp; Gold?&amp;nbsp; Bitcoin?&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href=&quot;http://nihoncassandra.blogspot.com/search?q=honus+wagner&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Honus Wagner baseball cards&lt;/a&gt;?&amp;nbsp; Besides, if the dollars have to pass through Washington, the spending side remains a target.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Therefore, absolutely the best way to inflate AGDP is to &lt;i&gt;increase private-sector capitalization&lt;/i&gt;, generating a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_effect&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;wealth effect&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Moreover, there are two ways to do this, since there are two forms of capital asset: debt and equity.&amp;nbsp; Debt is dangerous because it has to be paid back.&amp;nbsp; More on this in a moment.&amp;nbsp; So we have a second-best way to inflate AGDP, convincing the private sector to borrow more; and a first-best way, making the stock market and real estate go up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The latter is solution D-1, the absolute bestest way (from a political perspective) to create jobs, and the mainstay of the Greenspan-Bernanke era of American prosperity.&amp;nbsp; In short, our actual reality.&amp;nbsp; The former is solution D-2, as practiced in the great nation of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kangbashi_New_Area&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; (And, wonderfully, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilamba&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Angola&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is there a downside?&amp;nbsp; Of course there is.&amp;nbsp; Capitalization (debt or equity) is supposed to reflect actual capital.&amp;nbsp; When you increase capitalization (debt or equity) without a corresponding creation of productive assets, you are storing up trouble.&amp;nbsp; Excessive market cap is like nuclear waste.&amp;nbsp; If it gets out, as in 2008 - you have a problem.&amp;nbsp; Fortunately, this problem can always be solved by solution D-3, printing money to buy nuclear waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that all of this is a question of financial alchemy.&amp;nbsp; None of it has &lt;i&gt;anything at all&lt;/i&gt; to do with the resolution on your iPad, or other technology ingredients that go into computing the FGDP hedonic deflator.&amp;nbsp; It is all a matter of AGDP.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s true that AGDP inflation is reflected in FGDP, but the number that matters is AGDP - the quantity of money, not the quality of products.&amp;nbsp; If you try to solve the problem of inadequate AGDP inflation by improving the GDP deflator, ie, by better technology, you are committing cargo cult economics.&amp;nbsp; You are trying to cause a cause with an effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is there any problem at all with this insane machine?&amp;nbsp; Sure there is.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s insane, after all.&amp;nbsp; Its insanity is totally disproportionate to its actual purpose, ie, employing otherwise idle and useless humans.&amp;nbsp; As we&#39;ll see, a sane regime could accomplish the same goal far more sanely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A financial system is a central planning mechanism.&amp;nbsp; To the extent that a planning mechanism, whether automatic or bureaucratic, is sane, it instructs economic actors to make sane and rational decisions, like investing in productive assets.&amp;nbsp; To the extent that it instructs economic actors to do insane things, like building empty cities in the middle of Mongolia, its automatic and supposedly free-market nature is no different from the bureaucratic insanity of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gosplan&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Gosplan&lt;/a&gt;, or the autocratic insanity of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamoussoukro&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Houphouet-Boigny&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Of course, it still fulfills its actual mission of creating jobs.&amp;nbsp; But not without significant and unnecessary financial weirdness, whose only purpose is to pretend that the machine is not in fact a makework scheme.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In America, the consequence of job creation through AGDP inflation is the notorious &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIRE_economy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;FIRE economy&lt;/a&gt;, a central-planning system in which the only income source is asset-price inflation, and the employment created involves Mexican immigrants installing granite countertops and nice white ladies selling real estate to each other.&amp;nbsp; For instance, this is essentially the economy of Ohio, once one of the world&#39;s great industrial centers.&amp;nbsp; As a way for human beings to spend their time, frankly, it seems lame and depressing.&amp;nbsp; Is it that much better than digging ditches with spoons?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moreover, nuclear waste is dangerous.&amp;nbsp; A critical point is passed in an event like that of 2008, which might be described as the transition from debt capitalism to debt communism.&amp;nbsp; Under debt capitalism, it is possible to sustain the illusion that both borrower and lender are private-sector agents.&amp;nbsp; Under debt communism, a state we have now attained, borrowing remains a private action, but the Fed is now and forever the lender of first resort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is that in business terms, what&#39;s wrong with the American economy is very simple.&amp;nbsp; It loses money.&amp;nbsp; In order to keep operating on an even keel, it needs to borrow roughly $1.2T a year.&amp;nbsp; In other words, we have a simple way to get 2% AGDP growth per year - expand the debt bomb by 2% a year. We can also inflate the stock and real estate markets, which is better, of course, because equity does not create obligations.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s a way of enriching the rich at the expense of the poor, but hey, what else is new?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A money-losing economy, like a money-losing restaurant, sucks.&amp;nbsp; It sucks in all kinds of ways that have no apparent connection to finance.&amp;nbsp; The entire dining experience is grim.&amp;nbsp; This, indeed, is the experience of the entire &quot;old economy&quot; outside the little bubbles of Silicon Valley and Wall Street.&amp;nbsp; My in-laws live in Columbus.&amp;nbsp; Columbus sucks.&amp;nbsp; Even with Chairman Ben&#39;s 85-billion-a-month bond-buying &quot;recovery.&quot;&amp;nbsp; It is more and more palpably a Soviet restaurant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fantasy of the money-losing economy, like that of the money-losing restaurant, is that if enough money is pumped in, eventually the &quot;pump will be primed&quot; and the engine will restart on its own.&amp;nbsp; On this theory, America has been expanding its debt bomb since the 1930s.&amp;nbsp; Yo, it&#39;s not working.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;d be happy to bet any sum of money on what would happen if Chairman Ben turned off the QE.&amp;nbsp; If you are into professional betting, bet on zero interest rates for the infinite future.&amp;nbsp; &quot;Capitalism&quot; with zero interest rates is a mockery and a monstrosity - but there is no alternative within the system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worse, we will face a 2008 all over again when the private sector&#39;s debt becomes so large that even borrowing from an infinite lender is no longer a market operation.&amp;nbsp; Goldman Sachs can borrow at 0%, but you can&#39;t.&amp;nbsp; Debt has to be serviced.&amp;nbsp; Debt saturation happens.&amp;nbsp; When it happens, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt_deflation&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;debt deflation&lt;/a&gt; begins - and in a debt-deflation phase, even &lt;i&gt;borrowing at 0%&lt;/i&gt; is no longer a market operation.&amp;nbsp; Once debt deflation begins, there is no alternative but reflation by direct government spending, in the classic &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2004/200448/200448pap.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&quot;Bernanke helicopter&quot;&lt;/a&gt; mode.&amp;nbsp; While the political system is always capable of helicopter drops in theory, it may not be capable of it in practice.&amp;nbsp; And if it can achieve direct inflation, it has still entered a purely Soviet mode in which all investment is directed by the State.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And all this, just so that marginally employable Americans with an IQ of 95 can have jobs.&amp;nbsp; Which many of them can&#39;t.&amp;nbsp; Evaluated as a job creation mechanism, which is what it is, this insane financial inflation machine earns no better than a C-.&amp;nbsp; Granted, it has put us so far behind the debt 8-ball that if you turn it off, you go straight from C- to F-.&amp;nbsp; Which was about to happen in 2008 before Bernanke fired up his helicopter.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s a trap!&amp;nbsp; And the bait isn&#39;t even that tasty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So are there other solutions?&amp;nbsp; Is there a Solution E?&amp;nbsp; An F?&amp;nbsp; Well, sure.&amp;nbsp; They&#39;re not politically possible.&amp;nbsp; Nothing other than what we&#39;re doing now is politically possible, at least, not without regime change.&amp;nbsp; As Hunter S. Thompson put it, that bothers me the way VD bothers a Hell&#39;s Angel.&amp;nbsp; If not less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;E is a factor we left out: foreign trade.&amp;nbsp; As it happens, the US with its disastrous &lt;a href=&quot;http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS11300000&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;37% labor-force nonparticipation rate&lt;/a&gt; (ie, the real measurement of &quot;unemployment&quot;, which is commonly cited in terms of the meaningless benefit-claims number), besides borrowing $1.2T a year, runs a trade deficit of $600B a year.&amp;nbsp; Ie, 3% of US GDP.&amp;nbsp; What does this mean?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What it means is that if USG &lt;i&gt;entirely eliminated foreign trade&lt;/i&gt;, closing its ports like Tokugawa Japan, US businesses would experience an immediate 3% jump in gross revenue, and hence in employment.&amp;nbsp; Of course, this would involve a boom in import substitution industries and a bust in export industries, but the net effect would be a boom.&amp;nbsp; 500B ain&#39;t nothing.&amp;nbsp; The hedonic effect, of course, would be negative - but as we&#39;ve seen, inadequate hedonism is anything but our problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We could do even better than this.&amp;nbsp; We could eliminate imports, while maintaining exports.&amp;nbsp; Of course, we would be admitting the mercantilist reality of world trade, something our Asian trading &quot;partners&quot; already understand.&amp;nbsp; Does it hurt that much to say: &quot;Friedrich List was right?&quot;&amp;nbsp; Let&#39;s say that retaliation would cut our exports not to zero, but just in half.&amp;nbsp; In that case, we have $0 in imports and $650B in exports, meaning a net gain in revenue to US businesses of roughly 1.2T - and that&#39;s not counting a multiplier effect of money spent over and over again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, we&#39;d see some hedonic pain.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;d also see something like a 10% boost in AGDP overnight, as all the crap we buy from China now had to be made in America.&amp;nbsp; Which means a titanic economic boom perhaps unparalleled in history, except at the inception of the Third Reich when Hitler adopted more or less the same autarkic policies.&amp;nbsp; Less fun - more prosperity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Call me crazy, but I don&#39;t believe mercantilism - which, before Adam Smith, was no more than conventional wisdom in political economy - is inseparable from yet another persecution of the Jews.&amp;nbsp; Indeed, any pre-liberal mercantilist would regard the combination of free trade, massive trade deficits, and massive unemployment, as economic insanity on a par with persecuting the Jews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I&#39;m sure Professor Krugman, who can be accused of many things but not of misunderstanding the power of aggregate demand, understands this perfectly.&amp;nbsp; Which makes him yet another concern troll - ie, a person concerned not with solving the problem, but with exploiting it.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As List puts it, free trade is the weapon of the strong.&amp;nbsp; England and later America adopted free trade when we were strong.&amp;nbsp; Well, face it, we&#39;re not strong anymore.&amp;nbsp; But we keep hitting ourselves over the head with the weapon.&amp;nbsp; Why?&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s simple: blithering idiocy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yes, there is also a Solution F.&amp;nbsp; Solution F is a reality we&#39;ll eventually have to face: technology restriction.&amp;nbsp; Actually, Solution E is a special case of Solution F, because foreign imports are best considered as a technology of production.&amp;nbsp; From the perspective of the American economy, there is no difference between production by Chinese workers, and production by robots - both imply production which does not employ American workers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is hard to imagine technology restriction working, because we have to get past imagining this terribly powerful tool being wielded by our utterly incompetent and corrupt rulers.&amp;nbsp; The same problem exists in contemplating effective protectionism.&amp;nbsp; The most obvious outcomes of both these tools simply amount to featherbedding if not outright theft.&amp;nbsp; As a result, protectionism has gained a bad name, and technology restriction is well outside the policy landscape.&amp;nbsp; Yet in actual reality, the problem is not with the tool, but the wielder.&amp;nbsp; Once we admit that USG isn&#39;t working and has to go, we can imagine replacing it with something that doesn&#39;t suck - and can actually wield such a tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not suggesting across-the-board technology restriction, general medieval stasis, low-res iPads, banning Google Glass, or anything of the kind.&amp;nbsp; My idea of Solution F involves targeted technology controls designed to create market demand for the type of unskilled human laborers that modern industry has made obsolete, but that we are politically unwilling to kill and sell as organ meat.&amp;nbsp; Being so unwilling, we have no choice but to provide these people with a way to survive as human beings - preferably as human as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For instance, two forms of semi-skilled labor well-known to be good for the human soul are (a) craftsmanship and (b) farming.&amp;nbsp; Compared to the demand for these professions that once existed, both have been essentially eradicated.&amp;nbsp; How many meth-heads, thugz, etc, are there in America whose great-great-grandparents were craftsmen, farmers, or both?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Consider one targeted technology restriction: no plastic toys.&amp;nbsp; If my children are going to have toys, these toys will be made from wood, with hand tools, by Americans, in America.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results: (a) negative financial impact on parents who need to buy toys for their children, and might have to increase their toy budgets; (b) negative hedonic impact on children, whose toy bins are no longer filled with brightly colored Chinese plastic crap; (c) negative economic impact on China, which is not our country, so who cares; (d) gigantic economic boom in American wooden toy industry, providing employment to any fool who can whittle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How can anyone contemplating these outcomes not agree with me that (d) considerably outweighs the sum of (a), (b) and (c)?&amp;nbsp; Or take agricultural labor, for which an arbitrary level of demand can be created simply by banning industrial farming techniques.&amp;nbsp; Every ghetto rat in America today could find employment as an organic slow-food artisan.&amp;nbsp; Crap - even a 10th Street zombie can milk cows. We&#39;d have to pay them for their work, of course.&amp;nbsp; We already pay them for not working.&amp;nbsp; Is this better for us?&amp;nbsp; For them?&amp;nbsp; WTF, America?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is this unrealistic?&amp;nbsp; Of course it&#39;s unrealistic.&amp;nbsp; To be exact, it is completely inconsistent with consensus reality, to the point of seeming utterly bizarre.&amp;nbsp; I doubt a Sam Altman would even be able to evaluate it.&amp;nbsp; Normal sane people, especially rich ones, are socially well-integrated and live in consensus reality, ie, a Plato&#39;s cave of pure blithering idiocy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yet, I assert, in &lt;i&gt;actual&lt;/i&gt; reality - my Solutions E and F are slam-dunk no-brainers.&amp;nbsp; (We&#39;d still need a way to safely shut down the Solution D debt bomb, but that&#39;s a matter for another post.)&amp;nbsp; Will this gap ever be bridged?&amp;nbsp; Will we ever escape from the 20th century?&amp;nbsp; Almost certainly not.&amp;nbsp; But for whatever crazy reason, I still feel the need to point out that we could.&amp;nbsp; Perhaps it&#39;s just because I&#39;m a nut.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/feeds/5525744409219863154/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7958140996781104565&amp;postID=5525744409219863154' title='120 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7958140996781104565/posts/default/5525744409219863154'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7958140996781104565/posts/default/5525744409219863154'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2013/03/sam-altman-is-not-blithering-idiot.html' title='Sam Altman is not a blithering idiot'/><author><name>Mencius Moldbug</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/16472157249344139282</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>120</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7958140996781104565.post-1577728069789733559</id><published>2013-02-19T15:07:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2013-02-19T15:07:04.207-08:00</updated><title type='text'>The greatness of Lawrence Auster</title><content type='html'>In case you haven&#39;t heard, Larry is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amnation.com/vfr/archives/024252.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;dying&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Say a prayer for him, or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Greatness?&amp;nbsp; I don&#39;t know that anyone can really get away with the word in 2013.&amp;nbsp; What can greatness mean in a fourth-rate world?&amp;nbsp; In a fourth-rate world, the second-rate look great.&amp;nbsp; Worse, they feel great.&amp;nbsp; After all, they stand head and shoulders above their own age. &amp;nbsp; So why grow further?&amp;nbsp; Can we say that a Lawrence Auster saw farther, because he stood on the toes of dwarves?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Surely there&#39;s a bit of that.&amp;nbsp; I think Auster&#39;s work is best summarized by his statement, not a boast but merely the truth, that where the ordinary machine conservative takes a second look at our political narrative we live in, View from the Right took the second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth looks.&amp;nbsp; Very well.&amp;nbsp; I think our differences are best summarized by my feeling that six looks are entirely insufficient for our exquisitely sterquiline age, thirty or forty being perhaps more like it.&amp;nbsp; Six looks are certainly not enough to understand why Henry VII is worth taking seriously.&amp;nbsp; If indeed he is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But we did not visit VFR for a history of the past - but rather, a history of the present.&amp;nbsp; Are you by some strange chance reading this in the 22nd century?&amp;nbsp; Stranger things have happened.&amp;nbsp; Do you want to read the true story of the early 21st, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leopold_von_Ranke&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;wie est eigentlich gewesen&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;?&amp;nbsp; Find the VFR archive.&amp;nbsp; It must be somewhere.&amp;nbsp; Make sure you have a lot of time on your hands - or some kind of full-search FPGA in your medulla.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the characteristic mental disorders of our period is an easy contempt for the past.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s not just that we are taught to hate the past, for one can respect and still detest an enemy.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s that we despise it.&amp;nbsp; We observe it with an easy, swaggering and thoroughly unquestioned contempt.&amp;nbsp; We are &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentism_%28literary_and_historical_analysis%29&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;presentists&lt;/a&gt; with all the arrogance of the cartoon plantation racist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which leads us into many faults of the intellect, some of them comic.&amp;nbsp; But our worst fault is the belief that history, somehow, is &lt;i&gt;easy&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Of course it&#39;s easy to know what happened in the Civil War!&amp;nbsp; Every fifth-grader knows the story.&amp;nbsp; Heck, my four-year-old daughter knows the story.&amp;nbsp; She read about it in her Magic Treehouse books (which, by the way, are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/05/education/young-latino-students-dont-see-themselves-in-books.html?pagewanted=all&amp;amp;_r=0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;racist&lt;/a&gt;).&amp;nbsp; &quot;Oh, I know about the Civil War,&quot; she said.&amp;nbsp; Indeed she does - she knows about it the way everyone in 2013 does.&amp;nbsp; If a little less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Imagine the poor bastards who actually had to live in the past, being understood by a four-year-old.&amp;nbsp; Of course, it is no more possible for Sibyl to understand the Civil War than to fly to the moon.&amp;nbsp; She&#39;s a bright girl, but still.&amp;nbsp; She can only understand the period because it has been converted into a flat piece of paper with large print and a few pictures.&amp;nbsp; Imagine 2013, converted into a flat piece of paper with large print and a few pictures.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, this (with slightly smaller print than Magic Treehouse) is how most of us read not only the past, but the present.&amp;nbsp; Go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.upworthy.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Upworthy&lt;/a&gt;!&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s fresh, it&#39;s hip, it&#39;s socially relevant.&amp;nbsp; You will not have to think about anything for more than five seconds.&amp;nbsp; And, just like Magic Treehouse, it has pictures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not mean to suggest that complex realities are impossible to simplify accurately.&amp;nbsp; If it were impossible to present a complex reality as a simple narrative, it would be impossible to write history.&amp;nbsp; Possible?&amp;nbsp; Of course it&#39;s possible.&amp;nbsp; But it&#39;s not &lt;i&gt;easy&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Not at least if you want it to be &lt;i&gt;true&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps some historian of a future century, reading UR for a laugh, will find this link and pop over to VFR.&amp;nbsp; I was reading Carlyle one day when I saw, in a statistical footnote, a link to &lt;a href=&quot;http://books.google.com/books?id=nMqgOsBuoSoC&amp;amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;George Lunt&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; What sort of American would Carlyle cite on the Civil War?&amp;nbsp; All I know about George Lunt is that he published his book in 1866 in Boston.&amp;nbsp; Imagine the stones.&amp;nbsp; All I know about George Lunt is that he published his book in 1866 in Boston, and he had to have his pants cut specially.&amp;nbsp; Needless to say, his Civil War is not the Magic Treehouse Civil War.&amp;nbsp; (Nor is it the VFR Civil War, but let that pass.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it has become my Civil War - taken not just from Lunt, of course, but many others like him.&amp;nbsp; I trust George Lunt not because I know anything about him, aside from the pants, but because I can tell that he writes like a man whose only concern is telling the truth as he knows it.&amp;nbsp; How can I tell?&amp;nbsp; That&#39;s like asking a wine snob how he tells good wine from bad.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it would be a mistake to praise Auster simply for being a prophet.&amp;nbsp; &quot;Without honor in his own country&quot; - it&#39;s a cliche.&amp;nbsp; And true enough, like most cliches.&amp;nbsp; And it is true that in our age false prophets (so far as I can tell, the original Hebrew means no more than &quot;pundit&quot;) abound, and honest ones are hen&#39;s teeth.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this is really only the beginning of the tragedy.&amp;nbsp; There is something else - something perhaps best illustrated by one of my &lt;a href=&quot;http://books.google.com/books?id=dy4-AAAAYAAJ&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;favorite Edwardian sources&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;Sometimes in our haste we may permit ourselves to speak disparagingly of debate, and if the result of debate were merely the prevalence of eloquence over silence, of good arguments over bad ones, it might justly be condemned as a means of selecting men to govern the country. But debate is something a great deal more respectable.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;The glory of the British Parliament is that men subdue it by their characters to a far greater extent than by their arguments. It is required of a leader that he must be prepared at any moment to stand up to his enemies, to give blows and to take them. This test can never be escaped. Occasional brilliant appearances will never put any man in power, or keep him in power if he has happened to arrive there by some accident. Private influence or intrigue, literary gifts of the highest order, are all in vain. The system is sound, although of necessity it excludes many aspirants of shining talents. The rule is absolute that before a man may be permitted to govern the nation, he must have proved himself capable of prevailing over his rivals in single combat and face to face.&lt;/blockquote&gt;This passage seems like a memorandum from an alternate reality that never existed.&amp;nbsp; Was it really the case that Britain, for a couple of centuries in which it was the strongest nation on earth, was governed by... the Briton most capable of argument, whoever that might be?&amp;nbsp; Yes, in fact, it was.&amp;nbsp; (I forget the source, but it was a Victorian cliche that &quot;not everyone in Parliament deserves to be in Parliament, but everyone who deserves to be in Parliament is in Parliament.&quot;&amp;nbsp; Carlyle certainly could have been, had he cared to.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Indeed, what&#39;s so striking in this passage is the author&#39;s &lt;i&gt;casual assumption&lt;/i&gt; that whoever in Britain is most capable of humiliating his enemies in an argument, both is in Parliament and leads it, and in fact governs the country.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just as casually, we assume that the best quarterback in America today is (a) in the NFL, (b) plays quarterback in the NFL, and (c) is the first-string quarterback on his team.&amp;nbsp; Indeed this is true.&amp;nbsp; But consider the remarkable complexity of the machinery that &lt;i&gt;makes&lt;/i&gt; it true.&amp;nbsp; Can we imagine a world without this machinery?&amp;nbsp; Or with what pretends to be this machinery, but is not, and does not actually work?&amp;nbsp; It is almost more plausible than the world that actually exists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The world of 2013 contains no genuine parliamentary institutions.&amp;nbsp; It contains the dried, bureaucratic husks of many - just as it contains the dried, bureaucratic husks of many old monarchies.&amp;nbsp; Before nations were ruled by a man &quot;capable of prevailing over his rivals in single combat and face to face&quot; with the sword of his tongue, they were ruled by the actual sword.&amp;nbsp; The king was a military leader.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now we have no leaders of any kind.&amp;nbsp; At least, not in our political system.&amp;nbsp; Can you imagine a Barack Obama, stripped of his army of handlers, &quot;in single combat and face to face,&quot; in the old House of Commons or something like it, against... a Lawrence Auster?&amp;nbsp; Or even a Rush Limbaugh?&amp;nbsp; You might as well imagine Rush Limbaugh in a swordfight with Henry VII.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is what I see when I look at Auster&#39;s oeuvre - not just a prophet, but a leader.&amp;nbsp; A king, if you will.&amp;nbsp; A king out of water, in a dry and kingless age.&amp;nbsp; He was still born a king, or made himself one, and if you type in the right URL you can see it plain as day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does this have anything to do with Larry&#39;s faith?&amp;nbsp; Of course it does.&amp;nbsp; It is impossible to imagine a king who does not serve the King of Kings.&amp;nbsp; Or rather, if we imagine one, we find ourselves looking for other words, pejorative ones - like &quot;dictator.&quot;&amp;nbsp; What were Hitler and Stalin, but godless kings?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I&#39;ve already violated my daughter&#39;s privacy, I&#39;ll tell another story.&amp;nbsp; The other day we were driving down 14th Street and Sibyl was looking out the window.&amp;nbsp; Suddenly, from out of nowhere, I hear: &quot;It says, &#39;Christ is the answer.&#39;&amp;nbsp; What is Christ?&quot;&amp;nbsp; She made it rhyme with &quot;fist.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No Christian UR reader will ever forgive me for my answer.&amp;nbsp; After correcting her pronunciation, I said: &quot;Christ is the same thing as God, Sibyl.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s... it&#39;s... it&#39;s like Santa Claus for grownups.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually, there are few things that would please me more than seeing my daughter become a Christian.&amp;nbsp; If only because it would mean she was not a worshiper of Beyonce, or something worse.&amp;nbsp; I know all too well, however, that it is not in my power to raise her as one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The entire question of &quot;whether God exists&quot; seems to me entirely superfluous and sterile.&amp;nbsp; Anyone in the age of science who believes he has a mechanism for physically confirming the &quot;existence&quot; of the spirit world is not religious, but rather superstitious.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s certainly true that historical Christianity contains many superstitious and/or miraculous conceits, but it does not depend on them either for its practical efficacy as a social institution, or even for its logical coherence.&amp;nbsp; Every scientific period is a small bubble of the known in an infinite unknown space.&amp;nbsp; It is always possible to plausibly postulate an undisprovable entity.&amp;nbsp; When mankind was young and knew little, we could postulate a God who was a giant snake that lived in the river and made it rain.&amp;nbsp; Now, we can postulate a God who is an alien system administrator who runs the servers that make quantum mechanics work.&amp;nbsp; We can easily disprove the giant snake, but not the four-headed IT jock.&amp;nbsp; Ergo, we are left with the choice of two fundamentally &lt;i&gt;aesthetic&lt;/i&gt; arguments - Occam&#39;s razor versus &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Paley&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Paley&#39;s watchmaker&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, who cares?&amp;nbsp; Let&#39;s go with Occam&#39;s razor, which I&#39;ll always prefer because that&#39;s how I was raised.&amp;nbsp; Thus, as far as material reality goes, God, Christ and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_Spaghetti_Monster&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Flying Spaghetti Monster&lt;/a&gt; are all the same thing.&amp;nbsp; Fine.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m quite comfortable with this interpretation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you share it, let me ask you a question.&amp;nbsp; Does Hamlet exist?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously, Hamlet does not exist and nor did he ever.&amp;nbsp; Thus, when we consider only material reality, he fits perfectly in the same set with God, Christ, the FSM, and &quot;Santa Claus for grownups.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if we change the question to: &quot;is Hamlet a useful concept?&quot; we find that again everyone agrees.&amp;nbsp; Hamlet is a literary character, and perfectly real in that sense.&amp;nbsp; It is completely sensible to say, for instance, that someone is acting like Hamlet, or should be more like Hamlet, or should be less like Hamlet.&amp;nbsp; These statements are well-defined and cogent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also a well-defined and cogent statement to say that Lawrence Auster is a servant of God.&amp;nbsp; One can serve without orders.&amp;nbsp; Larry doesn&#39;t need God&#39;s cell-phone number to serve God, and nor for that matter does the Pope.&amp;nbsp; When we say &quot;God,&quot; we know what we mean - it is a shorthand for the superhuman and perfect, for infinite wisdom and intelligence, just as the character of Hamlet is a shorthand for a mercurial and hesitating character.&amp;nbsp; What, pray tell me, is the Flying Spaghetti Monster a shorthand for?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the level of evolutionary psychology, man is both a social animal and a hierarchical one.&amp;nbsp; Not only is he extremely good at defining and relating to characters, he is born with &quot;modules&quot; both for ruling and for serving.&amp;nbsp; Anyone living is the descendant of many kings and many, many servants.&amp;nbsp; Those kings, too, were born knowing how to serve.&amp;nbsp; Whom did they serve?&amp;nbsp; We know the answer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether a man is a king, a peasant or anything in between, to ask him to be an atheist and an egalitarian is to ask him not to use the machines in his brain that he was born with.&amp;nbsp; It is to diminish him as a human being.&amp;nbsp; The capacity to personalize the superhuman, and to use this fictional anthropomorphism as a mechanism by which we may &lt;i&gt;approach&lt;/i&gt; the superhuman, is characteristically human.&amp;nbsp; I suppose I will never be anything but a &quot;secular humanist,&quot; but I have learned in this way to respect, admire, and sometimes even envy my Christian friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For instance, characteristic of the enormous, and certainly &lt;i&gt;regal&lt;/i&gt;, dignity of the man, is the strength and honor with which Auster approaches death.&amp;nbsp; Socrates was not a Christian, nor was Cato, nor were the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forty-seven_Ronin&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;47 Ronin&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; So atheists need not despair of these qualities.&amp;nbsp; On the other hand, neither Socrates nor Cato had to live in the same world as Beyonce.&amp;nbsp; It strikes me as quite implausible that when our dark age ends and the kings return, if ever, it will be under any banner but the Cross.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or as Maistre put it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;Frenchmen, it was to the noise of hellish songs, the blasphemy of atheism, the cries of death, and the prolonged moans of slaughtered innocence, it was by the light of flames, on the debris of throne and altar, watered by the blood of the best of kings and an innumerable host of other victims, it was by the contempt of morality and the established faith, it was in the midst of every crime that your seducers and your tyrants founded what they call &lt;i&gt;your liberty&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when man works to restore order he associates himself with the author of order; he is favored by nature, that is to say, by ensemble of secondary forces that are the agents of the Divinity.&amp;nbsp; His action partakes of the divine; it becomes both gentle and imperious, forcing nothing yet not resisted by anything.&amp;nbsp; His arrangements restore health.&amp;nbsp; As he acts, he calms disquiet and the painful agitation that is the effect and symptom of disorder.&amp;nbsp; In the same way, the hands of a skilful surgeon bring the cessation of pain that proves the dislocated joint has been put right.&lt;/blockquote&gt;When I look at VFR, especially when I look at the thanks and well wishes of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amnation.com/vfr/archives/024252.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Larry&#39;s readers&lt;/a&gt;, this is what I see - a small area of order, in the hands of a skilful surgeon.&amp;nbsp; Who will not be with us much longer.&amp;nbsp; But humanity abides, and other surgeons will come.&amp;nbsp; They will need not a scalpel, but a sword.&amp;nbsp; Let us pray they are no less skilful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/feeds/1577728069789733559/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7958140996781104565&amp;postID=1577728069789733559' title='182 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7958140996781104565/posts/default/1577728069789733559'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7958140996781104565/posts/default/1577728069789733559'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2013/02/the-greatness-of-lawrence-auster.html' title='The greatness of Lawrence Auster'/><author><name>Mencius Moldbug</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/16472157249344139282</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>182</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7958140996781104565.post-6901576068298425577</id><published>2013-02-08T13:04:00.001-08:00</published><updated>2013-02-08T13:14:45.233-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Charles Stross discovers the Cathedral</title><content type='html'>&lt;div class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;Poor &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2013/02/political-failure-modes-and-th.html&quot;

A long, long time ago in a galaxy long since destroyed, he was an promising young SF writer and I was a promising young CS grad student, and we were both regulars on the same Usenet newsgroup, alt.peeves.&amp;nbsp; I met him once when he visited Berkeley.&amp;nbsp; I even read his unpublished novel - which I thought was good, but not great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Indeed this age has quite the glut of good writers.&amp;nbsp; Great ones?&amp;nbsp; Greatness is not a quality of our time. A &lt;i&gt;great&lt;/i&gt; writer, having read his Orwell, would never let himself get away with abusing the English word &lt;i&gt;dictatorship&lt;/i&gt; to mean &quot;government I don&#39;t like.&quot;&amp;nbsp; Do we live in a beige dictatorship?&amp;nbsp; Really?&amp;nbsp; Who, then, is our beige dictator?&amp;nbsp; Valerie Jarrett?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course the word Charlie&#39;s looking for is &lt;i&gt;oligarchy&lt;/i&gt;, and he even finds it further down the page.&amp;nbsp; He quotes &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Michels&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Robert Michels&lt;/a&gt;, for God&#39;s sake!&amp;nbsp; Comrade!&amp;nbsp; I have to hope you&#39;re just dropping Wiki links, comrade.&amp;nbsp; You can&#39;t have actually read &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.org/details/politicalparties00mich&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this book&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s on the restricted list - dangerous even for a loyal Party man in good standing.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Weren&#39;t you assigned Hardt and Negri?&amp;nbsp; Have you finished?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mean, if you&#39;re reading Michels, what will you get into next?&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.org/stream/democracypartysy00ostrrich#page/n7/mode/2up&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ostrogorski&lt;/a&gt;?&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elite_theory&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mosca and Pareto&lt;/a&gt;?&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.org/details/populargovernmen00mainiala&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Maine&lt;/a&gt;?&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href=&quot;http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2010/04/join-froude-society.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Froude and Carlyle&lt;/a&gt;?&amp;nbsp; Marijuana leads to heroin, you know.&amp;nbsp; A couple more clicks and suddenly, you discover that you&#39;ve spent the whole day marinating your delicate cortex in &lt;a href=&quot;http://books.google.com/books/about/A_Defence_of_Virginia.html?id=PwVnt4hozogC&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;R.L. Dabney&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Definitely no way to crank out the next cyberpunk space-opera blockbuster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And Comrade Stross, I&#39;d endeavour not to bring the Party into disrespect with palpable absurdities.&amp;nbsp; To wit:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;Something has gone &lt;i&gt;wrong&lt;/i&gt; with our political processes, on a  global scale. But what? It&#39;s obviously subtle — we haven&#39;t been on the  receiving end of a bunch of jack-booted fascists or their communist  equivalents organizing putsches.&lt;/blockquote&gt;If you want to point out that progressive democracies in the West have developed some of the same bureaucratic pathologies as the Eastern peoples&#39; democracies, that&#39;s one thing.&amp;nbsp; But don&#39;t you think it&#39;s a &lt;i&gt;little&lt;/i&gt; difficult to pretend that Western progressive democracy is equidistant from Hitler and Stalin?&amp;nbsp; From Comrade Stalin - &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.marxists.org/archive/malenkov/1949/12/21.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;leader of progressive mankind&lt;/a&gt;?&amp;nbsp; Really?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your reader may not know much about 20th-century history - hardly anyone does, really.&amp;nbsp; But you can&#39;t keep him from knowing that his government didn&#39;t collaborate with Hitler to smash Stalin.&amp;nbsp; (I have no joke - I just like saying, &lt;a href=&quot;http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2012/01/kiss-stalin-was-feeling-extremely-gay.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&quot;Stalin was feeling extremely gay.&quot;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, comrade.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s much better to come right out and lead the audience in a rousing rendition of that great New Laborite anthem, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Red_Flag&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Red Flag&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Don&#39;t try to pretend the revolution didn&#39;t happen.&amp;nbsp; That only distracts us from the critical task of figuring out who betrayed it.&amp;nbsp; Was it &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Miliband&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ralph Miliband&#39;s&lt;/a&gt; kids?&amp;nbsp; But they seemed so promising!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is how all great magicians work.&amp;nbsp; They keep you looking for something &quot;obviously subtle,&quot; while they saw the lady in half right in front of your face.&amp;nbsp; What happened?&amp;nbsp; Um, the revolution happened.&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Gramsci&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Slowly&lt;/a&gt;, it&#39;s true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A big favorite of the early 20C Laborites, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Dissenters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;English Dissenters&lt;/a&gt; to the marrow, was &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/And_did_those_feet_in_ancient_time&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Blake&#39;s great hymn&lt;/a&gt; (doesn&#39;t Billy Bragg do a version?):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;I will not cease from Mental Fight,&lt;br /&gt;Nor shall my Sword sleep in my hand:&lt;br /&gt;Till we have built Jerusalem,&lt;br /&gt;In England&#39;s green and pleasant Land.&lt;/blockquote&gt;How&#39;s that New Jerusalem workin&#39; out for ya?&amp;nbsp; Actually, &lt;a href=&quot;http://books.google.com/books?id=1iEiAAAAMAAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA480#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;pretty well&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;Meanwhile, it may with little fear of contradiction be asserted that there never was, in any nation of which we have a history, a time in which life and property were so secure as they are at present in England. The sense of security is almost everywhere diffused, in town and country alike, and it is in marked contrast to the sense of insecurity which prevailed even at the beginning of the present century.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are, of course, in most great cities, some quarters of evil repute in which assault and robbery are now and again committed. There is perhaps to be found a lingering and flickering tradition of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookery_%28slum%29&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;old sanctuaries&lt;/a&gt; and similar resorts. But any man of average stature and strength may wander about on foot and alone, at any hour of the day or the night, through the greatest of all cities and its suburbs, along the high roads, and through unfrequented country lanes, and never have so much as the thought of danger thrust upon him, unless he goes out of his way to court it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Oh, wait.&amp;nbsp; My mistake.&amp;nbsp; That&#39;s not the New Jerusalem, it&#39;s the old one - London in 1876.&amp;nbsp; Victorians!&amp;nbsp; Anglicans!&amp;nbsp; Morons!&amp;nbsp; What did they know from Mental Fight?&amp;nbsp; Exterminate the brutes!&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/dont-do-it-murdered-pimlico-teenager-hani-abou-el-kheir-pleaded-for-his-life-as-he-was-brutally-stabbed-by-a-gang-armed-with-swords-8469233.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Whereas&lt;/a&gt;, after a century and a half of Progress:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;A teenager who pleaded for his life as a gang armed with knives and swords chased and fatally stabbed him in the street was named yesterday as Hani Hicham Abou El-Kheir.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Witnesses described how the 16-year-old tripped while he was being pursued by a group of up to 15 youths close to home on a housing estate in well-heeled Pimlico and shouted “don’t do it” as he was surrounded. His mother rushed to the scene and had to be held back from a police cordon as medics battled in vain to save his life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Police said last night they were keeping an open mind about the motive for the attack. A youth worker said there had been a concerted attempt by drug dealers to move into the area in recent months but although Hani’s name had been mentioned “on the periphery” of a gang, he had not been considered a significant or known member.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The attack shortly before 7pm on Sunday night took place close to Pimlico Tube station on a street flanked by multi-million pound houses and an estate of local authority tower blocks where Hani is believed to have lived with his mother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One onlooker said that his killers ran away “as if nothing had happened” after having “jumped on him like a pack of dogs”. He was heard to plead “don’t do it” as the gang, many of whom witnesses said were wearing hoodies and bandanas across their faces, repeatedly stabbed him.&lt;/blockquote&gt;I guess someone&#39;s sword isn&#39;t sleeping in his hand.&amp;nbsp; Swords!&amp;nbsp; I love swords.&amp;nbsp; Always and everywhere, science fiction needs more swords.&amp;nbsp; Meanwhile, the great SF writer himself recently spent a weekend in our own vibrant metropolis of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2013/01/incidentally-4.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&quot;warm, sunny Detroit,&quot;&lt;/a&gt; where I&#39;m sure he took the time to &quot;wander about on foot and alone.&quot;&amp;nbsp; Nah.&amp;nbsp; Just kidding.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m sure he took an armored vehicle straight from the airport to the hotel.&amp;nbsp; And back again.&amp;nbsp; Ah, the 21st century.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Am I digressing?&amp;nbsp; No, I&#39;m not digressing.&amp;nbsp; Crime and government are the same thing - power imposed by force.&amp;nbsp; Always and everywhere, crime is nano-tyranny.&amp;nbsp; In the last minute of Hani Hicham Abou El-Kheir&#39;s life, there was only one government that mattered - a tiny circle of sovereignty, containing&amp;nbsp; oppressed (Mr. El-Kheir) and oppressor (15 &quot;youths&quot; wielding swords).&amp;nbsp; This government, smaller than the Queen&#39;s but no less real, condemned Mr. El-Kheir to death, no doubt for some real or imagined offence, enforced the penalty, and then dispersed.&amp;nbsp; Hopefully the Queen&#39;s grim stormtroopers will at some point capture the rebel regime, perhaps issuing the leader a stern &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-social_behaviour_order&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Asbo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One great Englishman, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ine_of_Wessex&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;King Ine of Wessex&lt;/a&gt;, wrote &lt;a href=&quot;http://historyofengland.typepad.com/documents_in_english_hist/2012/10/selected-laws-of-ine-688-695.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;eloquently&lt;/a&gt; of this phenomenon, nano-government.&amp;nbsp; By the laws of King Ine, if there are up to 7 sword-wielding &quot;youths,&quot; they are thieves; from 7 to 35, bandits; and if over 35, an army.&amp;nbsp; This is objective social science at its finest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the young Englishmen of Pimlico care to be taken seriously, then, they&#39;d best recruit at least 20 more good English youths.&amp;nbsp; With swords.&amp;nbsp; But how hard is that?&amp;nbsp; Can&#39;t you print a sword, or 20, with a Makerbot?&amp;nbsp; Moreover, though there are only 20 million Englishmen and thus potential swordsmen, it&#39;s the 21st century.&amp;nbsp; Change has come.&amp;nbsp; And anyone with two legs who isn&#39;t a bird is an Englishman.&amp;nbsp; At least, if Ralph Miliband&#39;s kids have issued him the proper documents.&amp;nbsp; And paper, you&#39;ll note, is even easier to print than a sword.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sort of thing doesn&#39;t bother a good Party man, of course.&amp;nbsp; Democracy, as we know, is messy.&amp;nbsp; (Look at the Arab Spring!&amp;nbsp; Glorious!&amp;nbsp; But messy!)&amp;nbsp; And kids are always up to some kind of shenanigans.&amp;nbsp; No, England&#39;s real tragedy is that &lt;i&gt;government services are being outsourced&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Indeed, it&#39;s quite possible that whoever had to clean Mr. Al-Kheir&#39;s four gallons off the Pimlico pavement was, in fact, a &lt;i&gt;private contractor&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; (Probably an Englishman of, well, Polish descent.&amp;nbsp; Why work, when you can import slaves?)&amp;nbsp; How low can England sink?&amp;nbsp; What would Lord Passfield say?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay.&amp;nbsp; Now I am digressing.&amp;nbsp; This is just ridicule.&amp;nbsp; Indeed, England&#39;s real tragedy is that England has become, for possibly the first time since Gildas was a little boy, ridiculous.&amp;nbsp; This precious stone, set in the silver sea... sceptered it remains; but the scepter is, unmistakably, Nerf; and the hand that once so bravely wielded it, now, appears to be, well, &lt;i&gt;stroking....&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I do have a serious answer to Charlie&#39;s question.&amp;nbsp; Because, after all, we agree.&amp;nbsp; A &quot;beige oligarchy&quot; - definitely &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_bag_party&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&quot;brown paper bag&quot;&lt;/a&gt; reference - is exactly what we have.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s exactly what we&#39;ll always have, until some other Aristotelian form replaces it.&amp;nbsp; (A good comrade can read &lt;a href=&quot;http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/politics.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Aristotle&lt;/a&gt;, but not apply him.)&amp;nbsp; Per Aristotle, there are three forms of government - by the many, by the few, by the one; democracy, oligarchy, monarchy.&amp;nbsp; In England and elsewhere, how do we escape the beige oligarchy and get back to democracy?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ha!&amp;nbsp; How does a cow fly to the moon?&amp;nbsp; It doesn&#39;t.&amp;nbsp; We can&#39;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I realize that this is very difficult to accept for people brought up to see democracy not only &lt;i&gt;as what ought to be,&lt;/i&gt; but also as &lt;i&gt;what is&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Here at UR, we believe that not only &lt;i&gt;shouldn&#39;t it be&lt;/i&gt;, but &lt;i&gt;it isn&#39;t&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Moreover, &lt;i&gt;it can&#39;t be&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Always and everywhere, the strong rule the weak.&amp;nbsp; 15 youths with swords rule 1 youth with no sword.&amp;nbsp; If Mr. Al-Kheir had wanted to &quot;wander, on foot and alone,&quot; through the wilds of central London, he had a simple way to do so.&amp;nbsp; He should have brought his sword and 14 friends.&amp;nbsp; He felt that he had a &lt;i&gt;natural right&lt;/i&gt; to &quot;wander, on foot and alone,&quot; and the Queen&#39;s law supported him in this opinion.&amp;nbsp; But it was not the Queen who ruled this patch of Pimlico.&amp;nbsp; Had Mr. Al-Kheir been more attentive to &lt;i&gt;what is&lt;/i&gt;, not &lt;i&gt;what ought to be&lt;/i&gt;, he might be sitting at home reading a Charles Stross novel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The constitution of a country is a mockery and a sham unless it reflects the real structure and possession of power in the country.&amp;nbsp; Suppose &quot;Martian invaders&quot; invade America and take over Washington.&amp;nbsp; All power is held by the Martian invaders, with their death-rays.&amp;nbsp; But they don&#39;t bother to cancel the Constitution - why should they?&amp;nbsp; We therefore see a divergence of power between the &lt;i&gt;real&lt;/i&gt; authorities, the Martian invaders, and the &lt;i&gt;nominal&lt;/i&gt; authorities, the American people.&amp;nbsp; In this case, is America still a democracy?&amp;nbsp; Nominally, yes.&amp;nbsp; Really, no.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While there are no Martian invaders, it is &lt;a href=&quot;http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2010/11/democracy-cis-and-trans-maines-law.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;relatively straightforward&lt;/a&gt; for us to distinguish between two kinds of democracy: one kind, in which power genuinely flows upward from what people want, and another kind, in which power flows downward from the beige oligarchy / Martian invaders, is converted into what they&#39;re supposed to think, and regurgitated dutifully at the polls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charlie, do you really want a political system in which power genuinely flows upward from what most people want?&amp;nbsp; I have two words for you.&amp;nbsp; The first is the name of a Biblical prophet.&amp;nbsp; The second is &quot;Powell.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In postwar Europe, there is a codeword for a political persuasion in which power flows upward.&amp;nbsp; The codeword is &quot;populist.&quot;&amp;nbsp; Needless to say, no more vile slur can pass the lips of a good Party man.&amp;nbsp; A &quot;beige dictatorship?&quot;&amp;nbsp; Please, man.&amp;nbsp; Don&#39;t complain about the dish you ordered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I don&#39;t care to frighten you with bugbears.&amp;nbsp; The reality of the 20th century is that &lt;i&gt;populists lose&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Populists lose because &lt;i&gt;populism is democracy&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;democracy is weak&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; For instance, democracy as a form of government originated in mob violence.&amp;nbsp; It was a mob that chased Charles I out of London.&amp;nbsp; Then, democracy was strong and monarchy was weak, and as always the strong ruled the weak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is still mob violence in London, of course, but it is not organized and therefore cannot exercise power - and in any case, it is underclass violence, and therefore aligned with the Party.&amp;nbsp; There is certainly no &lt;i&gt;populist violence&lt;/i&gt; in London, and there hasn&#39;t been any for &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1958_Notting_Hill_race_riots&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;50 years&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; The beige oligarchy has zero tolerance for &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; And even the idiotic &quot;race riots&quot; of the &#39;50s were a pathetic shadow of the Elizabethan mob, which had no trouble at all in ripping the throats out of every Flemish merchant in the City if they thought they were being gouged on the wool price. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So we have an interesting situation, in which a political force, once physically powerful, became represented in formal authority as a way to recognize and regularize its capacity for violence.&amp;nbsp; But it no longer has that capacity for violence.&amp;nbsp; Nor does it have any capacity to govern - not that it ever had any, really.&amp;nbsp; And without the capacity to govern, it also lacks the capacity to retain its position of genuine authority, either by political craft or brute force.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Therefore, we can expect exactly the result that we observe - retention of symbolic authority, loss of actual authority.&amp;nbsp; Of course, for any such loss, there must be a gainer.&amp;nbsp; Hence the beige oligarchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Democracy is a historically rare and transient phenomenon, of course, but retention of symbolic power when real power has been lost is a very common trope.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s just a trope that usually happens not to democracies, but to monarchs - who are pwned usually by bureaucratic oligarchies, though sometimes by other monarchs (consider the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clovis_IV&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Merovingian kings&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I think of the Western democratic electorate, as a force which claims the capacity and reality of ruling, yet has been utterly used by the utterly anti-democratic beige oligarchy, I find it very easy to translate it into the language of monarchy.&amp;nbsp; We all hate monarchy, of course - the Party has taught us well!&amp;nbsp; But somehow, we still know its language.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Imagine you&#39;re the King of France.&amp;nbsp; You have the hereditary right to rule France, just as Englishmen have the hereditary right to rule England.&amp;nbsp; Why?&amp;nbsp; Because.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s the constitution.&amp;nbsp; So, sovereignty is yours, unlimited and absolute sovereignty, and everyone has to do what you say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except - there&#39;s just one problem.&amp;nbsp; The problem is: you&#39;re seven years old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#39;s simply no way that France will be ruled by a seven-year-old.&amp;nbsp; But sovereignty is conserved.&amp;nbsp; Always and everywhere, France is ruled by someone.&amp;nbsp; At best, it might be ruled by someone who claims he&#39;s taking orders from a seven-year-old.&amp;nbsp; It might even be the case that the seven-year-old, if bright, actually writes down the order, which the wise minister has suggested to him.&amp;nbsp; But there is no possible way in which, in reality, France is ruled by a seven-year-old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#39;s a great passage in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Huang&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ray Huang&#39;s&lt;/a&gt; classic, &lt;i&gt;1587: A Year of No Significance&lt;/i&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;When &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wanli_Emperor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Wan-li&lt;/a&gt; was in his early teens, he merely followed Big Companion Feng&#39;s instructions, affixing his own rescripts in vermilion ink on certain papers to make official the drafts in black submitted by Tutor Chang&#39;s office.&amp;nbsp; The documents that he personally worked on involved simple replies such as &lt;i&gt;Approved&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Acknowledged&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; When the rescripts involved complicated phraseology, the work was, as a rule, delegated to Feng Pao&#39;s staff of assistants.&amp;nbsp; These proceedings were completely in agreement with the dynasty&#39;s established practice.&amp;nbsp; An instruction written in red in the emperor&#39;s presence carried the authority of the throne.&amp;nbsp; On the other hand, any unauthorized use of the vermilion brush constituted falsification of imperial orders, a crime subject to the mandatory death penalty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It must have been some time before the young emperor grasped the mechanics of the institutional process, of which he himself was the central figure.&amp;nbsp; There is no evidence, for instance, that, when in those early days he carried out his official duty in a way not fundamentally different from calligraphy lessons, he fully understood the import of his own rescript &lt;i&gt;Acknowledged&lt;/i&gt;, which really meant that the suggestion or request embodied in the paper had been politely rejected, and that, considering the noncontroversial nature of the proposal, no action would be taken against the writer of the paper or others mentioned therein.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One duty Wan-li could not delegate had to do with his power of appointment.&amp;nbsp; The problem was solved in this way: whenever there was a vacancy in a high office, Tutor Chang and the ministers always submitted more than one candidate for the emperor&#39;s selection.&amp;nbsp; When he circled one person&#39;s name with his vermilion brush, that person was appointed, and the emperor had ostensibly made a decision of his own.&amp;nbsp; However, he had early been indoctrinated to believe that the person whose name topped the list was best qualified.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Could any more penetrating portrait of an American election be penned?&amp;nbsp; &quot;Not fundamentally different from calligraphy lessons.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is one difference between democratic electorates and child monarchs.&amp;nbsp; Child monarchs grow up.&amp;nbsp; Unless they are Henry VI, they become men.&amp;nbsp; They acquire virtue, capacity, and strength.&amp;nbsp; And at that point, the day of &quot;Big Companion Feng&quot; is over.&amp;nbsp; Here&#39;s (per &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_History_of_England_%28Hume%29&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Hume&lt;/a&gt;) how one of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_III_of_England&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;greatest of English kings&lt;/a&gt; dealt with his own &quot;Big Companion Feng&quot;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;It was impossible that these abuses could long escape the observation of a prince endowed with so much spirit and judgment as young Edward, who, being now in his eighteenth year, and feeling himself capable of governing, repined at being held in fetters by this insolent minister. But so much was he surrounded by the emissaries of Mortimer, that it behooved him to conduct the project for subverting him with the same secrecy and precaution as if he had been forming a conspiracy against his sovereign.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;He communicated his intentions to Lord Mountacute, who engaged the Lords Molins and Clifford, Sir John Nevil of Hornby, Sir Edward Bohun, Ufford, and others, to enter into their views; and the Castle of Nottingham was chosen for the scene of the enterprise. The queen dowager and Mortimer lodged in that fortress: the king also was admitted, though with a few only of his attendants: and as the castle was strictly guarded, the gates locked every evening, and the keys carried to the queen, it became necessary to communicate the design to Sir William Eland, the governor, who zealously took part in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By his direction, the king&#39;s associates were admitted through a subterraneous passage, which had formerly been contrived for a secret outlet from the castle, but was now buried in rubbish; and Mortimer, without having it in his power to make resistance, was suddenly seized in an apartment adjoining to the queen&#39;s. A parliament was immediately summoned for his condemnation. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;He was accused before that assembly of having usurped regal power from the council of regency appointed by parliament; of having procured the death of the late king; of having deceived the earl of Kent into a conspiracy to restore that prince; of having solicited and obtained exorbitant grants of the royal demesnes; of having dissipated the public treasure; of secreting twenty thousand marks of the money paid by the king of Scotland; and of other crimes and misdemeanors. The parliament condemned him from the supposed notoriety of the facts, without trial, or hearing his answer, or examining a witness; and he was hanged on a gibbet at the Elmes, in the neighborhood of London.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Simple, dramatic, final, and effective.&amp;nbsp; Of course, the Earl of March had only one neck.&amp;nbsp; How do you hang a beige oligarchy?&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s an easy answer, which is &quot;more gibbets.&quot; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this is the wrong answer, really.&amp;nbsp; There are two right answers.&amp;nbsp; One is that English democracy is no more capable of hanging, deposing, or even &lt;i&gt;slightly troubling&lt;/i&gt; its beige oligarchy, than a cow of flying to the moon.&amp;nbsp; That&#39;s the bad news.&amp;nbsp; The good news is: Aristotle didn&#39;t say there were only two forms of government.&amp;nbsp; He said there were three.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is only one thing that can replace a &quot;beige dictatorship&quot; - a non-beige dictatorship.&amp;nbsp; That is, monarchy in the dictionary sense of the word - concentration of official authority in one man, or at least one office.&amp;nbsp; This man, or office, can hang anyone (or someone has authority to overrule him, which means the monarchy is no monarchy at all); and doesn&#39;t need to hang anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why not?&amp;nbsp; Because the former bureaucratic oligarchs will crawl up to his feet and lick them, begging to retain their jobs.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Most will be disappointed, but so what?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only is none of them the Earl of March, but none of these Party men are desperate, bomb-throwing revolutionaries, however much they like to believe it.&amp;nbsp; They are silky-soft bureaucrats.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s 2013, not 1913, and all a Party man knows how to do is cozen for power.&amp;nbsp; If he can no longer find appropriate bureaucratic employment, he can always drive a cab.&amp;nbsp; Maybe someone will find some testicles and throw a bomb, and in this case he does unfortunately need to be hanged - &lt;i&gt;pour encourager les autres&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; I assume the ol&#39; sceptered isle still has a gallows or two in some back room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is England&#39;s problem?&amp;nbsp; What is the West&#39;s problem?&amp;nbsp; In my jaundiced, reactionary mind, the entire problem can be summed up in two words - &lt;i&gt;chronic kinglessness&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; The old machine is missing a part.&amp;nbsp; In fact, it&#39;s a testament to the machine&#39;s quality that it functioned so long, and so well, without that part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#39;t even need a reactionary to be king.&amp;nbsp; Let&#39;s just find someone talented with a lot more fans than me - such as, I don&#39;t know, Charlie Stross.&amp;nbsp; Is he enlightened?&amp;nbsp; Of course he&#39;s not enlightened, though this Michels thing is quite promising.&amp;nbsp; It doesn&#39;t matter.&amp;nbsp; The job will enlighten him - or anybody with the capacity to do it.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/feeds/6901576068298425577/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7958140996781104565&amp;postID=6901576068298425577' title='60 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7958140996781104565/posts/default/6901576068298425577'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7958140996781104565/posts/default/6901576068298425577'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2013/02/charles-stross-discovers-cathedral.html' title='Charles Stross discovers the Cathedral'/><author><name>Mencius Moldbug</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/16472157249344139282</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>60</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7958140996781104565.post-9210974128662046775</id><published>2013-01-23T16:38:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2013-01-23T17:07:58.921-08:00</updated><title type='text'>How Bitcoin dies</title><content type='html'>TL:DR - Bitcoin dies in two very simple steps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1: A DOJ indictment is unsealed which names everyone on Planet Three who operates, or has ever operated, or perhaps who has ever even &lt;i&gt;breathed on&lt;/i&gt;, a BTC/USD exchange, as a criminal defendant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charge: money laundering.&amp;nbsp; The evidence: the defendants knew that BTC were used for &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Road_%28marketplace%29&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;organized criminal activity&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Therefore, they knew they were transferring money for criminals.&amp;nbsp; This is quite simply the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_laundering&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;definition&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of &quot;money laundering.&quot; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Obviously, prosecution under our modern &quot;rule of law&quot; proceeds according to these broad definitions, without regard to any specific technicalities.&amp;nbsp; For instance, Aaron Swartz downloaded many more papers from JSTOR than JSTOR wanted him to.&amp;nbsp; Therefore, he used JSTOR&#39;s computers in a way that JSTOR didn&#39;t want them to be used.&amp;nbsp; Therefore, he could be prosecuted for &quot;computer hacking.&quot; Indeed he seemed to sense this when he put his bike helmet over his face and ran from the police.&amp;nbsp; The details?&amp;nbsp; They might have mattered, at the trial.&amp;nbsp; But of course there was no trial.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2: The BTC/USD price falls to 0 and remains there.&amp;nbsp; BTC are permanently worthless.&amp;nbsp; Everyone who was involved in the Bitcoin market and was holding BTC when the indictments were unsealed feels burned.&amp;nbsp; Everyone who got out feels lucky.&amp;nbsp; Many who escape prosecution, in fact, feel lucky.&amp;nbsp; And BTC is remembered as an epic bubble. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very strong prediction.&amp;nbsp; Am I right?&amp;nbsp; Am I this confident?&amp;nbsp; I never get hate mail.&amp;nbsp; Really - never.&amp;nbsp; But won&#39;t I get hate mail for this?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously, I have no inside information at all and am just speculating - as a devout student of the fascinating organism that is USG.&amp;nbsp; However, my guess is that this event will happen soon - ie, probably in 2013.&amp;nbsp; Why?&amp;nbsp; Because of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ecb.int/pub/pdf/other/virtualcurrencyschemes201210en.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ECB report on Bitcoin&lt;/a&gt;, which quoth:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;All these issues raise serious concerns regarding the legal status and security of the system, as well as the finality and irrevocability of the transactions, in a system which is not subject to any kind of public oversight. In June 2011 two US senators, Charles Schumer and Joe Manchin, wrote to the Attorney General and to the Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration expressing their worries about Bitcoin and its use for illegal purposes. Mr Andresen was also asked to give a presentation to the CIA about this virtual currency scheme. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Further action from other authorities can reasonably be expected in the near future.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Neighbor, if you&#39;re at all involved with BTC, I&#39;d advise you to heed this remarkably direct warning. You&#39;ll note that (a) the people who wrote this report &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; have inside information (since the ECB and our own dear &quot;other authorities&quot; operate, of course, in practice as a single global institution), and (b) these are people with &lt;i&gt;actual power&lt;/i&gt;, and people with actual power tend to do what they say they&#39;re going to do - regardless of how Reddit might feel about the matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously, I am no fan of USG, DOJ, or JSTOR.&amp;nbsp; My ideal outcome  for the Aaron Swartz case would have involved Aaron getting away with  it, and putting the JSTOR archive online.&amp;nbsp; Indeed this would have been a  remarkable and wonderful outcome.&amp;nbsp; I can only hope the next person who tries the same thing comes has the same talents as Aaron Swartz, but brings his A game and comes armed for bear.&amp;nbsp; But certainly, don&#39;t take on the Man if you have any suspicion that the Man might take you instead. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And when it comes to USG, and USD - creating a successful distributed digital currency is what I call &quot;coup-complete.&quot;&amp;nbsp; Ie, as a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-complete&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;difficult problem&lt;/a&gt;, it is fundamentally equivalent to the well-known difficult problem of regime change.&amp;nbsp; Are coups impossible?&amp;nbsp; No, of course not.&amp;nbsp; What&#39;s impossible, however, is pulling a coup when you don&#39;t know you&#39;re even trying to pull a coup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Government control (excuse me, &quot;public oversight&quot;) of all major monetary transactions is one of the basic attributes of sovereignty in the modern world.&amp;nbsp; If you can get away with &quot;money laundering,&quot; ie, circumventing this control, you can get away with anything.&amp;nbsp; If you can systematically disable it, perhaps you yourself are the new regime.&amp;nbsp; You&#39;re certainly on the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Indeed, if we all traded in our dollars and dollar assets, and fully restandardized the global monetary system on BTC (technically a &lt;i&gt;far&lt;/i&gt; superior design), it&#39;s quite possible that Satoshi Nakamoto himself would simply emerge as our new global overlord.&amp;nbsp; I suspect he&#39;d be richer than the Rockefellers.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; How do you indict that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My guess, solely from the broad public hint above, is that the collective bureaucratic decision to unleash the full right arm of USG on BTC was almost certainly made in 2012 or even 2011.&amp;nbsp; An easy decision - since it makes a lot of work for all the deciding agencies. &amp;nbsp; Meanwhile, the Bitcoin economy is buzzing merrily along, as if there was nothing wrong at all with Bitcoin.&amp;nbsp; Technically and economically, there &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; nothing wrong.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s a remarkably beautiful architecture - in fact, I would say, a genuine &lt;a href=&quot;http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2349257&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;work of art&lt;/a&gt; in the field of system software.&amp;nbsp; Its problems are entirely political.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, okay, that&#39;s not entirely true.&amp;nbsp; Bitcoin&#39;s engineering is impeccable and its economic design is entirely sound.&amp;nbsp; But most Bitcoin users - and, more important, supporters - seem to be laboring under a dangerous delusion as to the economic cause and effect behind Bitcoin&#39;s success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To me, and I hope to other UR readers, the logical leap from step 1 (BTC exchangers are indicted) to step 2 (BTC price goes to 0) is obvious.&amp;nbsp; But here at UR, we are operating under our own special theory of money, which I have modestly dubbed MoMT (Moldbug Monetary Theory).&amp;nbsp; If you know and believe MoMT, the leap is obvious.&amp;nbsp; In the conventional wisdom, it&#39;s not obvious at all.&amp;nbsp; In fact, it&#39;s unclear why BTC wouldn&#39;t just preserve its value as is - without any gateway to USD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, MoMT tells us that money has anomalous value only because economic agents rationally speculate in it, whereas conventional thought (whether Austrian or orthodox) holds that money&#39;s price is explained primarily by its use in trade.&amp;nbsp; We are right, because we can explain ourselves clearly and they can&#39;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4606270&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;an example&lt;/a&gt; of the conventional wisdom (the author is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3787375&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;professional quant trader&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;[BTC] is not an asset, it is a currency. Asset values do well when investors buy-and-hold for the long-term. Currencies die that way - they increase in value when they are traded, i.e. transacted in. A high ratio of buy-and-hold investors to merchant activity in a currency is a sign of speculative build-up. Paradoxically, the attractiveness of a currency to trade in is partially a function of how well it holds value - price level volatility bodes badly for that cause. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;and&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;A currency&#39;s value isn&#39;t a function of how much of it is outstanding but how much is transacted in it. If &quot;most bitcoins are held by...people&quot; holding on speculation, they contribute to holding its value down (don&#39;t think of stocks with dividends, think of fx).&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;I tremble for teh markets when I reflect that God is just.&amp;nbsp; And not just the BTC markets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My general sense is that most Bitcoin boosters think this way.&amp;nbsp; If you hold BTC and you think this way, please let me take a moment to change your mind, so you can get out of East Gomorrah before DOJ turns you into a pillar of salt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, BTC is a distributed currency, so nothing USG can do can really stop the Internets from trading goods for BTC.&amp;nbsp; Well, they can do one thing to stop the Internets from trading goods for BTC.&amp;nbsp; They can make the price go to zero.&amp;nbsp; Then, no one will care.&amp;nbsp; But how do they do that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#39;s engage in some very simple causal thinking about the price of BTC.&amp;nbsp; BTC, like every other economic good, is an &lt;i&gt;asset&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; BTC, like every other asset, does not have a &quot;value&quot; - nothing has a &lt;i&gt;value&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; BTC, like every other asset, has a &lt;i&gt;price&lt;/i&gt; - an exchange rate with USD.&amp;nbsp; (It has prices in all currencies, but all reflect the same variable.)&amp;nbsp; And, like all market prices, this exchange rate is set by supply and demand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On any given day, smoothing out intraday volatility, the USD/BTC exchange rate is set such that the quantity of USD that BTC holders want to buy with BTC, and the quantity of BTC that USD holders want to buy with USD, is equal.&amp;nbsp; Again the same is true for any price, ie, exchange rate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me try a different word than &quot;holders&quot; - &quot;speculators.&quot;&amp;nbsp; It has a wonderful 20C retro ring.&amp;nbsp; The connotations of &quot;speculators&quot; are so negative that I always want to say, &quot;speculators and Jews.&quot;&amp;nbsp; Suffice it to say that there are many people who think they believe in free-market economics, but don&#39;t.&amp;nbsp; You can hear it when they use &quot;speculators&quot; to mean &quot;holders&quot; - or &quot;privilege&quot; to mean &quot;property.&quot;&amp;nbsp; Mr. Orwell was definitely on to something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is the direct effect of a BTC-for-goods exchange on this price?&amp;nbsp; Obviously, zero.&amp;nbsp; The size of the BTC economy, or the velocity of BTC in that economy, or for that matter the size of the USD economy and its own velocity, have &lt;i&gt;no direct impact&lt;/i&gt; on the USD/BTC exchange rate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speculation is conserved.&lt;i&gt;&amp;nbsp; Everyone&lt;/i&gt; who holds a currency, or an security denominated in said currency, is a &quot;speculator.&quot;&amp;nbsp; First and foremost, they are speculating that the currency will not, relative to some other currency, decrease in its exchange price so as to make their investment a loser, relative to some other currency etc.&amp;nbsp; If your bond portfolio returned 6% last year, but gold went up 9%, you have speculated incorrectly; if you could go back in time and speculate again, you would speculate instead in gold.&amp;nbsp; (It&#39;s hard out there for a Jew.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, as always in MoMT, all these speculators are solving a joint &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_game&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;coordination problem&lt;/a&gt; with multiple &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_equilibrium&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Nash equilibria&lt;/a&gt; and need to find a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focal_point_%28game_theory%29&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Schelling point&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; There is always at least one overvalued commodity, asset or security, whose monetary premium usually explains most of its price.&amp;nbsp; In BTC, the monetary premium explains the &lt;i&gt;entire&lt;/i&gt; price.&amp;nbsp; A better thought experiment could not be designed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One could argue that BTC/goods trading volume has a &lt;i&gt;psychological&lt;/i&gt; effect on the set of actors who do, or could, speculate in BTC.&amp;nbsp; Sure.&amp;nbsp; I didn&#39;t say &quot;no impact,&quot; I said &quot;no direct impact.&quot;&amp;nbsp; In a sense, monetary standardization is a situation in which, when enough people believe in fairies, the fairies become real.&amp;nbsp; For the shrewd speculator, however, it is essential to always know the truth - even when participating vicariously, even profitably, in a collective lie.&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunspots_%28economics%29&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Sunspots&lt;/a&gt; would do as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But wait, you say.&amp;nbsp; Surely, BTC-for-goods exchange has &lt;i&gt;some&lt;/i&gt; direct impact on the BTC price, because people need to buy BTC - with USD - so they can buy their weed on Silk Road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this is true enough, the effect of this round-trip transaction on the BTC price is negligible, because it quickly reverses itself - unless your weed connection is also a BTC speculator.&amp;nbsp; Let&#39;s think about this for a minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Imagine that the BTC/USD market is perfectly liquid with no exchange overhead.&amp;nbsp; Imagine also that there are two types of BTC users: Jews, who speculate (holding BTC long-term with the expectation that it will appreciate against USD); and Aryans, who only trade (and sweep all BTC balances into USD at the end of every day).&amp;nbsp; These are simplifications, of course - but edifying ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#39;ll see instantly that, since all overnight holders of BTC are Jews, if there are no Jews the overnight price of BTC in USD is 0.&amp;nbsp; The Aryans have no one to sell to at the end of the day.&amp;nbsp; Ergo, their BTC is worthless - and remains worthless in the morning.&amp;nbsp; &lt;i&gt;If no one wants to speculate in a currency, if the currency is held only temporarily by traders for frictional reasons, the velocity of money goes to infinity and the price to zero.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/i&gt;(Of course, friction ensures that once the price is zero, the velocity goes back to zero as well.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So DOJ, to crush Bitcoin utterly, doesn&#39;t need to do anything about the Aryans.&amp;nbsp; It doesn&#39;t need to be able to stop people from securely exchanging Bitcoin for goods.&amp;nbsp; They will stop on their own, when the BTC price goes to 0 - after DOJ crushes the Jews. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How does this work?&amp;nbsp; Well, suppose you&#39;re a Jew and hold 1000 worth of BTC.&amp;nbsp; (In your own private wallet, of course - not on some fool&#39;s server.)&amp;nbsp; At 8:59 tomorrow morning, you have something.&amp;nbsp; The price of a pretty decent Harley, in fact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But at 9:00, the hypothetical indictments are unsealed (again, I have no inside knowledge at all).&amp;nbsp; Google Now tells you right away.&amp;nbsp; Your impulse?&amp;nbsp; Your impulse is to go to your favorite BTC exchange and sell.&amp;nbsp; All of a sudden, you&#39;d really really really rather have that Harley.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But... your favorite exchange isn&#39;t open.&amp;nbsp; In fact, the domain name seems to have been seized.&amp;nbsp; Same with the next three you try.&amp;nbsp; Finally, you get down to #12 on your list.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s 9:30.&amp;nbsp; The URL is being frantically passed around.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s in Russia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fine, it&#39;s in Russia!&amp;nbsp; Give me rubles!&amp;nbsp; I don&#39;t care!&amp;nbsp; Anything!&amp;nbsp; But alas.&amp;nbsp; You cannot even get rubles for your BTC.&amp;nbsp; Everyone wants to sell.&amp;nbsp; No one wants to buy.&amp;nbsp; A classic market panic, with no mitigating factors whatsoever.&amp;nbsp; What could stop it?&amp;nbsp; The price goes all the way down to zero.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;And I don&#39;t mean epsilon - I mean 0.&amp;nbsp; At the very beginning, the BTC price was epsilon because almost no one believed in fairies.&amp;nbsp; But some people did - because these people could, collectively, see the future.&amp;nbsp; BTC did not have a present, but it had a future.&amp;nbsp; Which turned out, for the lucky, to be a much larger number than epsilon.&amp;nbsp; And these people - successful speculators - indeed made bank.&amp;nbsp; The best of them will keep this bank, by selling high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the crackdown I expect (but, of course, hope won&#39;t happen - these &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt;, after all, government agencies, so hope really can spring eternal) there will be neither present nor future for BTC, just a past.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Even today&#39;s lame Bitcoin competitors (for obvious reasons, if you understand monetary standardization) have a market cap of epsilon.&amp;nbsp; Why epsilon?&amp;nbsp; Because they have a small fragment of a future.&amp;nbsp; A possible future.&amp;nbsp; The Bitcoin network could screw up its crypto somehow, or something.&amp;nbsp; It won&#39;t.&amp;nbsp; But fine, maybe it&#39;s worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whereas after any such crackdown, it will be plain as day that Bitcoin and anything like it have no future at all.&amp;nbsp; Those who speculated and stayed in speculated unwisely, because they chose a monetary standard that had all the qualities of a successful currency except one: resistance to government attack.&amp;nbsp; You&#39;ll note that our fine USG securities, while substandard on many indicators of monetary quality, have the world&#39;s only perfect score in this department.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I have one lesson to impart, here at UR, it is this: USG is what it is.&amp;nbsp; It is not what you want it to be.&amp;nbsp; It is not what you hope it will become.&amp;nbsp; It is &lt;i&gt;certainly&lt;/i&gt; not what it claims to be.&amp;nbsp; No - it is what it is.&amp;nbsp; Respect that reality, and you will neither run afoul of Leviathan, nor live &quot;free&quot; as his spiritual servant.&amp;nbsp; In short: think for yourself and obey the strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Also, you should note that gold, while by no means &lt;i&gt;perfectly&lt;/i&gt; resistant to USG attack, is at least &lt;i&gt;somewhat&lt;/i&gt; resistant to USG attack - especially since we don&#39;t have anything like the badass USG of 1933.&amp;nbsp; While Au scores very poorly on some monetary standardization metrics, such as investment return, it does very well on others, including some where USD really doesn&#39;t sparkle.&amp;nbsp; Especially with reserve-accumulating central banks participating more and more openly in the monetary-standardization game (ie, &quot;China buying on the dips&quot;), the remonetization of gold can go much further than it already has, and strikes me as unlikely to reverse its course without some kind of major restructuring in the global economy, eg, a disastrous outbreak of democracy in China.)</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/feeds/9210974128662046775/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7958140996781104565&amp;postID=9210974128662046775' title='102 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7958140996781104565/posts/default/9210974128662046775'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7958140996781104565/posts/default/9210974128662046775'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2013/01/how-bitcoin-dies.html' title='How Bitcoin dies'/><author><name>Mencius Moldbug</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/16472157249344139282</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>102</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7958140996781104565.post-5250098139673358792</id><published>2013-01-19T14:44:00.001-08:00</published><updated>2013-01-19T14:45:50.214-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Christians have right to vandalize abortion clinics, Duke law professor claims</title><content type='html'>Yes, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thepublicdomain.org/2013/01/18/the-prosecution-of-aaron-a-response-to-orin-kerr/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;really&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; My italics:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“On the second question, I think the proper level of punishment in this case would be based primarily on the principle of what lawyers call “special deterrence.” In plain English, here’s the key question: What punishment was the minimum necessary to deter Swartz from continuing to try to use unlawful means to achieve his reform goals? I don’t think I know the answer to that question, but that’s the question I would answer to determine the proper level of punishment.”  He argues that Aaron’s announced ideals would lead him to violate the law again and that therefore the prosecutor would be right to ask for a sentence sufficient to stop that hypothetical continued criminal conduct.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now maybe this is right.  But I think it is a lot more revolutionary than &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.volokh.com/2013/01/16/the-criminal-charges-against-aaron-swartz-part-2-prosecutorial-discretion/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Orin&lt;/a&gt; gives it credit for and a lot more contentious than his post suggests.  I return to the Martin Luther King or Rosa Parks examples.  &lt;i&gt;(Or if you prefer, the anti-abortion activist who trespasses on Planned Parenthood in order to spray paint his slogan.)&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Legislatures had enacted segregation laws.  If Dr. King trespasses and violates state rules mandating segregation, and announces that he considers these laws wrong and that he will encourage others to do the same in the future, do we really believe that the prosecutor should ramp up the penalty until it would amount to special deterrence?  What would that take?  Death?  Life imprisonment?  Is that then “not disproportionate”?  I would have thought that one of the reasons we treat the protester who acts out of conviction (even conviction we disagree with) more leniently, is that we recognize that this is not mere profit seeking, not mere personal interest, and that in the past, such protesters have eventually changed our minds about the rightness of the actions the law prohibits.  There are limits to leniency, surely.  But there seem few limits on Orin’s special deterrence.&lt;/blockquote&gt;There are, of course, no limits on &lt;a href=&quot;http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl302/texts/hobbes/leviathan-d.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;absolute sovereignty&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;m quite confident that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thepublicdomain.org/bio/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Professor Boyle&lt;/a&gt; doesn&#39;t really believe Christians have the right to vandalize abortion clinics.&amp;nbsp; As he makes quite clear by his use of Movement dog-whistles such as &quot;reform&quot; and &quot;change,&quot; what he really means is: the Party has the right to change the law, by displaying its own power to protect, even glorify, those who break it.&amp;nbsp; The kulaks? Neighbor, don&#39;t be ridiculous.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The kulak exists to be beaten.&amp;nbsp; This is why &quot;kulak&quot; means &quot;fist.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Special deterrence&quot; is just one of the many 20th-century euphemisms which we use to cover the fact that we know perfectly well that might makes right.&amp;nbsp; That is: Christians do not in fact have the right to vandalize abortion clinics (and get away with it, as Professor Boyle and I agree in wishing Aaron Swartz had gotten away with his JSTOR hack.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why don&#39;t Christians have the right to vandalize abortion clinics?&amp;nbsp; Because they do not have the might to do so (and get away with it).&amp;nbsp; If they did, Christians would be on top and progressives would be on the bottom.&amp;nbsp; We would live in a different country - one in which, as in most legal codes in human history around the globe, abortion was considered a serious crime.&amp;nbsp; And there would be, of course, no such thing as an &quot;abortion clinic.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice to every sort of activist is: whatever the law is, wherever you are, follow it at all times.&amp;nbsp; Don&#39;t even ask whether you have the power to break it and get away with it.&amp;nbsp; If you have to ask - you don&#39;t.&amp;nbsp; If you don&#39;t have to ask, why are you asking me?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a power structure the American political system is a real work of art.&amp;nbsp; For instance, one of the most basic ways to show power over someone is to take away something he has and wants to keep.&amp;nbsp; It doesn&#39;t have to be anything valuable, either to you or to him.&amp;nbsp; Though it can be.&amp;nbsp; Ideally, though, it&#39;s of no real value to you, but considerable value (perhaps only sentimental or irrational value) to him.&amp;nbsp; That way, it&#39;s clear to everyone what the exercise is about: as Lenin put it, who beats whom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually think it&#39;s really wonderful that President Obama, even before the second term of his historic presidency, has jumped out so hard on the good old reliable beat-the-kulaks campaign trail.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s always fun to be an overdog.&amp;nbsp; But never forget to actually play the part.&amp;nbsp; If you stop beating people, they might forget that you&#39;re in charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moreover, that creates a situation of great potential entertainment for our most important branch of the entertainment industry.&amp;nbsp; It has two sides: those who want A to beat B, and those who want B not to be beaten.&amp;nbsp; These are extreme positions, of course.&amp;nbsp; The moderate center believes that B should certainly be beaten, but not too badly - a sane position that almost always prevails.&amp;nbsp; It is actually rumored that a long time ago, in a galaxy far far away, it was actually B who beat and A who was beaten.&amp;nbsp; But no one can actually believe it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the poor kulak?&amp;nbsp; Well, it used to be well-known that the poor need poverty.&amp;nbsp; (Then it was forgotten - and had to be proven.)&amp;nbsp; Similarly, &lt;a href=&quot;http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2009-06-25/news/0906240981_1_pension-board-boyle-chicago-outfit&quot;

target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Aaron Swartz&lt;/a&gt; - not that I ever met him.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; In fact, to be extremely honest (and I genuinely regret this), I was happy when I heard of his legal problems.&amp;nbsp; Why?&amp;nbsp; Is this just because I&#39;m a bad person?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe.&amp;nbsp; For one thing, failed child prodigies always have it in for non-failed child prodigies.&amp;nbsp; For another, deplorable Ashkenazi ghetto inbreeding produced a world in which a picture of me at any age is easily mistaken for Aaron Swartz at the same age - which is just creepy.&amp;nbsp; And at whatever age, reliable reports have it that the deceased equaled or even exceeded my own record as a supremely obnoxious little twerp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But finally, there was Aaron&#39;s (isn&#39;t it a sad comment on our age that the only address which seems appropriate for a dead 26-year-old man is his first name, as if he was still a teenager?&amp;nbsp; But aren&#39;t we all still teenagers these days?) soul-devouring &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/epiphany&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Chomskyism&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; While Aaron was alive, this was easy to resent.&amp;nbsp; Since he is dead, what remains can only be regret.&amp;nbsp; So, let&#39;s regret.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Y&#39;all can blame who you like for Aaron&#39;s suicide.&amp;nbsp; I blame Noam Chomsky, whose supercharged blue pills have devastated kilotons of innocent young brains as a regrettable side effect of winning Professor Chomsky enormous fame and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/news/issuesideas/story.html?id=1385b76d-6c34-4c22-942a-18b71f2c4a44&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;wealth&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; The typical teenage victim &lt;i&gt;knows&lt;/i&gt;, with every bone in his naturally rebellious body, that he&#39;s grown up in Plato&#39;s cave.&amp;nbsp; Our Professor, renowned the world over but especially in Venezuela, agrees!&amp;nbsp; And helpfully guides his innocent charge to an oddly well-lit shaft in the back of the cave which leads down to... an even deeper cave.&amp;nbsp; Coach Sandusky had nothin&#39; on him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How does this work?&amp;nbsp; Aaron, born one of humanity&#39;s natural nobles, grows up in a century cleansed by military force of its own cultural heritage, in which all surviving noble ideals are leftist ideals.&amp;nbsp; No one ever had a chance to tell him that his only honorable option was to live in the past.&amp;nbsp; And in any case, that option was probably too antisocial even for Aaron Swartz.&amp;nbsp; He must be noble, he cannot retreat to mere selfish bourgeois money-grubbing and family-rearing.&amp;nbsp; So he must be an activist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So he takes the blue pill.&amp;nbsp; He starts with a blue joint or two and gradually works his way up to the blue heroin.&amp;nbsp; He believes in his century&#39;s narrative as it is - except more so.&amp;nbsp; Why not more so?&amp;nbsp; For even without marinating his brain in Chomsky, what bright young person can miss all the trouble our polity has in living up to its own comm - I mean, &quot;progressive&quot; - ideals?&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Nazis are beaten, supposedly.&amp;nbsp; But somehow the seeds of autocracy are everywhere.&amp;nbsp; Wherever you see a corporation, you see a little Third Reich with its own pompous CEO-fuehrer.&amp;nbsp; Wherever you see property, especially inherited property (have you noticed the increasingly universal meme of saying &quot;privilege&quot; when you mean &quot;property?&quot;), you see a little king of a little kingdom, whose answer to &quot;why do you own this&quot; is no more than &quot;because I do.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an Aaron Swartz bred on Horace instead of John Dewey might have remarked, &lt;i&gt;tamen usque recurret.&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp; Of course the utopia is unachievable.&amp;nbsp; As a geek world which had not Chomsky but &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaetano_Mosca&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mosca&lt;/a&gt; on its dogeared hackerspace bookshelves would know in its bones, autocracy is universal and cannot be repealed, only concealed.&amp;nbsp; Always and everywhere, strong minorities rule weak majorities.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You cannot drive out nature with a pitchfork.&amp;nbsp; You can drive out great oaks with an axe.&amp;nbsp; But you already did that.&amp;nbsp; What did you get?&amp;nbsp; Weeds - giant, pitchfork-proof weeds.&amp;nbsp; Autocratic and unaccountable power in the modern democracy has been dispersed, but not in any way dissolved.&amp;nbsp; Sovereignty remains conserved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Indeed by any metric there is far more woody biomass than ever before.&amp;nbsp; The US Attorney&#39;s office has also its little kings, no more accountable than Henry VII.&amp;nbsp; Who took orders only from God, just like any &quot;apolitical&quot; &quot;civil servant.&quot;&amp;nbsp; But at least there was only one Henry VII.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Broadly speaking, decision-making authority (ie, power) in a modern democracy is divided between two kinds of people: lobbyists and activists.&amp;nbsp; Lobbyists are only interested in money.&amp;nbsp; Activists are only interested in power.&amp;nbsp; Sometimes a great nexus of corruption thrusts forth a figure of genius, such as Al Gore, who dazzles us with a talent for both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then of course, we have the poor passionate true believers.&amp;nbsp; I love the Obama administration because it is so easy to tell the Aaron Swartzes, the Glenn Greenwalds, the Chomskyites who actually believe in Chomsky (which may, or may not, include the master himself - who ever knows?), from the rest of the Morgul-army.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m quite convinced that Glenn Greenwald really has no idea at all why liberal public opinion stopped giving a damn about torture in 2008.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#39;s how Chomsky kills: first, he sets you to the pitchfork.&amp;nbsp; In the Plato&#39;s cave of Chomsky it is not nature, of course, that you are driving out with a pitchfork.&amp;nbsp; It is black, unnatural, fascist conspiracy.&amp;nbsp; Which is naturally everywhere - and yet, everywhere in embryo.&amp;nbsp; Giant terrifying kings and dictators are nowhere to be hacked and sawn.&amp;nbsp; It was your ancestors who had this privilege.&amp;nbsp; Today, in a diminished age, the enemy is no more than the seeds and sprouts of advancing black reaction, whose every great stump is crowned with dangerous suckers. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And while these seedlings are everywhere, each is small and weak.&amp;nbsp; Individually, they yield quite handily to the hoe, giving the stalwart farmer a sense of progress and victory.&amp;nbsp; If only a local sense.&amp;nbsp; For the activist who is only really interested in power, this is quite enough.&amp;nbsp; He just wants to be part of something that&#39;s fighting something else.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s a normal human drive.&amp;nbsp; And of course, his team is the winning team, which he likes quite well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can be this farmer, and live a happy, successful and fulfilling life.&amp;nbsp; But be sure to focus on the seedlings.&amp;nbsp; Or the old dead stumps.&amp;nbsp; Notice, however, that the vines which slew those old trees have grown so great and woody that they almost resemble trees themselves... and you are in for a different experience.&amp;nbsp; At the very least, you&#39;ll need to come back with something sharper than a pitchfork.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The truth is that the weapons of &quot;activism&quot; are not weapons which the weak can use against the strong.&amp;nbsp; They are weapons the strong can use against the weak.&amp;nbsp; When the weak try to use them against the strong, the outcome is... well... suicidal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who was stronger - Dr. King, or Bull Connor?&amp;nbsp; Well, we have a pretty good test for who was stronger.&amp;nbsp; Who won?&amp;nbsp; In the real story, overdogs win.&amp;nbsp; Who had the full force of the world&#39;s strongest government on his side?&amp;nbsp; Who had a small-town police force staffed with backward hicks?&amp;nbsp; In the real story, overdogs win. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Civil disobedience&quot; is no more than a way for the overdog to say to the underdog: I am so strong that you cannot enforce your &quot;laws&quot; upon me.&amp;nbsp; I am strong and might makes right - I give you the law, not you me.&amp;nbsp; Don&#39;t think the losing party in this conflict didn&#39;t try its own &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand_in_the_Schoolhouse_Door&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&quot;civil disobedience.&quot; &lt;/a&gt;And even its own &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16th_Street_Baptist_Church_bombing&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&quot;active measures.&quot;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; Which availed them - what?&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quod_licet_Iovi,_non_licet_bovi&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Quod licet Jovi, non licet bovi&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the real world in which we live, the weak had better know their own weakness.&amp;nbsp; If they would gather their strength, do it!&amp;nbsp; But without fighting, even &quot;civil disobedience.&quot;&amp;nbsp; To break a law is to fight.&amp;nbsp; Those who fight had better be strong.&amp;nbsp; Those who are not strong, had better not fight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And this is how Chomskyism killed Aaron Swartz and may yet get its hands on a similar figure, Julian Assange.&amp;nbsp; You know, when I read that Assange had his hands on a huge dump of DoD and State documents, I figured we would never see those cables.&amp;nbsp; Sure enough, the first thing he released was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rXPrfnU3G0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;some DoD material&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why?&amp;nbsp; Well, obviously, Assange knew the score.&amp;nbsp; He knew that Arlington is weak and Georgetown is strong.&amp;nbsp; He knew that he could tweak Arlington&#39;s nose all day long and party on it, making big friends in high society, and no one would even think about reaching out and touching him.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Or so I thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, my cynicism was unjustified.&amp;nbsp; In fact, Assange turned out to be a true believer, not a canny schemer.&amp;nbsp; He was not content to wield his sword against the usual devils of the Chomsky narrative.&amp;nbsp; Oh no, the poor fscker believed that he was actually there to take on the &lt;i&gt;actual&lt;/i&gt; powers that be.&amp;nbsp; Who are actually, of course, unlike the cartoon villains... strong.&amp;nbsp; If he didn&#39;t know that... he knows it now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Better to be a live dog than a dead hero.&amp;nbsp; But had Aaron Swartz plugged his laptop into the Exxon internal network and downloaded everything Beelzebub knows about fracking, he would be a live hero to this day.&amp;nbsp; Why?&amp;nbsp; Because no ambitious Federal prosecutor in the 21st century would see a route to career success through hounding some activist at Exxon&#39;s behest.&amp;nbsp; Your prosecutor would have to actually believe he was living in the Chomsky world.&amp;nbsp; Which he can&#39;t, because that narrative is completely inconsistent with the real world he goes to work in every day. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when you take on a &lt;i&gt;genuinely respected institution &lt;/i&gt;- whether State or MIT - your &quot;civil disobedience&quot; has all the prospects of George Wallace in the schoolhouse door.&amp;nbsp; Listen to &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.org/stream/GuerillaOpenAccessManifesto/Goamjuly2008#page/n0/mode/1up&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Swartz&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;de1&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;There is no justice in following unjust laws. It’s time  to come into the light and, in the grand tradition of civil  disobedience, declare our opposition to this private theft of public  culture.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;de2&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;de1&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;We need to take information, wherever it is stored,  make our copies and share them with the world. We need to take stuff  that&#39;s out of copyright and add it to the archive. We need to buy secret  databases and put them on the Web. We need to download scientific  journals and upload them to file sharing networks. We need to fight for  Guerilla Open Access.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;de1&quot;&gt;You&#39;ll note the tone of this manifesto, which is the typical vaunting, bullying tone of the powerful addressing the powerless.&amp;nbsp; Your so-called laws are worthless, it says, because law means nothing without power.&amp;nbsp; It is we who have the power, we who make the real laws.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;de1&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;de1&quot;&gt;Yes, indeed!&amp;nbsp; Today, it is really the progressive activist who is closest to the essential truth of all political endeavor - the fact that Might makes Right.&amp;nbsp; (What pathetic scraps of the American peasant right remain will probably &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freedomworks.org/blog/lheal/limiting-government-through-the-culture-war&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;figure this out&lt;/a&gt; shortly before my cat discovers the Higgs boson.&amp;nbsp; And I don&#39;t even have a cat.&amp;nbsp; Culture drives politics!&amp;nbsp; Tell it to the Albigensians.&amp;nbsp; If culture drove politics, Nazi Germany would still be Nazi.) &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;de1&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;de1&quot;&gt;Of course the man of the left cannot &lt;i&gt;admit&lt;/i&gt; that he has discovered this forbidden secret of history.&amp;nbsp; Indeed with every breath he must shout its converse.&amp;nbsp; But he knows it in every bone of his body, and if he is a prudent leftist his actions bear it out.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;de1&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;de1&quot;&gt;If he is not a prudent leftist?&amp;nbsp; Then he takes his beliefs seriously, and speaks actual truth to actual power.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Well, ya know, power doesn&#39;t like that much.&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/feeds/69990867424282756/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7958140996781104565&amp;postID=69990867424282756' title='108 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7958140996781104565/posts/default/69990867424282756'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7958140996781104565/posts/default/69990867424282756'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2013/01/noam-chomsky-killed-aaron-swartz.html' title='Noam Chomsky killed Aaron Swartz'/><author><name>Mencius Moldbug</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/16472157249344139282</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>108</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-7958140996781104565.post-481047550674776667</id><published>2013-01-05T14:01:00.003-08:00</published><updated>2013-01-05T14:01:53.598-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Are we big in France?</title><content type='html'>Tom Waits, of course, is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SUDZ30_PXg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;big in Japan&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; I haven&#39;t looked at the numbers.&amp;nbsp; I am pretty confident that UR is not big in Japan.

Can you share some perspectives on the role of conflict and migration in Rome&#39;s historical leadership of the international community?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;I see what moves you in these instances&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Of ancient gallantry: you say the world&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;On land and sea was conquered, you retrace&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The thousands of triumphant victories&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;And heavy spoils borne through the midst of Rome.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Would you, O Roman, have me tell the cause&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Of your success and of the high renown&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;That has impressed your yoke upon the world?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;God willed to join the peoples and the realms&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Of different languages and hostile cults&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Under the same empire and make all men&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Accept the bonds of one harmonious rule, &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;So that religion might unite all hearts;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;For there can be no union worthy of Christ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Unless one spirit reigns throughout the earth.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Concord alone knows God, alone it pays&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Due homage to the Father: harmony&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Among men wins His blessings for the world,&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Discord drives Him away, war saddens Him,&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Peace pleases Him, good will possesses Him.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;In all lands bounded by the western sea&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;And brightened by Aurora&#39;s shining dawn,&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bellona was inflaming all mankind&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;And arming savage hands for mortal wounds.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;To curb this madness, God has everywhere&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Taught nations to accept the selfsame laws&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;And Romans to become -- all by the Rhine&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;And Danube washed, by Tagus&#39; golden flood,&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The great Ebro and Hesperia&#39;s horned stream,&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Ganges and warm Nile with seven mouths,&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;He bound them by a common law and name&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;And brought them into bonds of brotherhood.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;In all the world they live as citizens&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Within their native city&#39;s sheltering walls,&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;United round the same ancestral hearth.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Tribes far apart and sundered by the sea&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Are brought together through appeals and trials&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;In common courts, through their commerce and trades&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;In crowded marts, through intermarriage&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;With those of other climes; for many bloods&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Are intermingled in a single race.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Thanks, Prudentius!&amp;nbsp; As we know, tolerance has always been a core Roman value.&amp;nbsp; Or has it?&amp;nbsp; As I think Symmachus and many other conservatives would argue, Rome became mistress of the world through the valor of her arms and the virtue of her unsullied blood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, that was before the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenney_Frank&quot;&gt;waters of the Orontes&lt;/a&gt; emptied themselves into the Tiber, rejuvenating our Empire with vibrant diversity and &lt;a href=&quot;http://marginalrevolution.com/&quot;&gt;cheap chalupas&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; But doesn&#39;t it seem a little risky to abandon the last symbols of this ancient military tradition?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;If I may take the part of Rome, the words&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;I speak now in her name befit her more.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Since she disdains to mourn her banished gods,&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;To say the aegis fought for her in war&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;And that she faints beneath the weight of years,&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;She hails her princes in a joyful voice:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&#39;I greet you, famous leaders, noble sons&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Of an unconquered emperor under whom&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;I shed old age and saw my silver hair&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Turn gold again: time blights all mortal things,&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;But length of days has given me new life,&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;And I have learned to have no fear of death.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;At last my years are shown due reverence;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;I merit the name of mistress of the world,&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;When now an olive spray my helmet crowns,&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;And verdant garlands veil my grim sword-belt,&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;While, armed, I worship God without bloodshed.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dark Jupiter led me on to crime, alas,&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;And I profaned my sword, inured to war,&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;With holy blood of martyrs slain by me.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nero, inspired by him, his mother killed,&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Then drank the Apostles&#39; blood, soiled my fair name&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;With blood of saints and marked me with his crimes...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Your reign alone has cleansed me of this guilt.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;My life is holy now, once impious&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Through Jove, I must confess.&amp;nbsp; What cruelty&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Did he not teach, what good did he demand?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Alarmed at seeing praise of Christ take root,&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;He burned with wrath and stained the world with blood.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Some dare to blame us for disastrous wars,&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Since we have spurned the altars of the gods,&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;And say that Hannibal was driven back&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;By Mars and Jupiter from the Colline Gate,&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;That from the Capitol Senones fled&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Because the gods fought on the rock above!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Let those who harp upon our past defeats&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;And ancient woes note that in your regime&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;I suffer no such ills.&amp;nbsp; No savage foe&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Knocks at my gates, no strange barbarian&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Roams through my captured streets and carries off&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;My youth in bondage far beyond the Alps.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Thanks, Prudentius.&amp;nbsp; You&#39;re confident, then, about the military situation on the Gothic frontier.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;ve had some issues there, of course, but &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stilicho&quot;&gt;Stilicho&lt;/a&gt; does seem to have matters well in hand.&amp;nbsp; And I must say, it&#39;s a remarkable testament to Rome&#39;s Christian tolerance that for the first time in her long history she&#39;s chosen a &lt;i&gt;magister militum&lt;/i&gt; who&#39;s openly proud of his Vandal heritage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what about economics and climate change?&amp;nbsp; Symmachus claims that we&#39;ve seen an unprecedented string of droughts and famines since Rome abandoned her old gods.&amp;nbsp; These are unproven allegations, of course.&amp;nbsp; Still, how do you react?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Does the dry bed drink up the stream midway,&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Or sudden crevice swallow up the flood&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;And keep the tide from covering furrowed lands&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;And spreading over Egypt&#39;s arid plains,&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Softening the clods with penetrating surge,&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;So that the corn may wave on ample fields&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;And clothe them thickly with the heavy ears?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;See whether African farmers cease to load&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Their ships with grain and send their stacks of wheat&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;To Tiber&#39;s mouth to feed the multitude,&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Or Leontinian tillers of the soil&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Stop launching grain cargoes from Lilybaeum,&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Or fleets that bring Sardinian stores to burst&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The granaries of Rome no longer sail.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Do Carthaginian yeomen heap their boards&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;With woodland pears, Sicilians feed on roots,&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sardinians furnish acorns from their oaks&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;And stony cornels form the food of Rome?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Who now comes hungry to the circus shows?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;What mill is silent on Janiculum?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;What great provisions every province brings,&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;What harvests from the earth&#39;s rich bosoms flow&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Is shown by bread you give your people, Rome,&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Which feeds the sloth of such great multitudes.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Wow!&amp;nbsp; Well, frankly, I may be biased, but I think that&#39;s a pretty eloquent testament to Rome&#39;s financial strength, and ought to come as a big relief to some of our audience who may have been misled by conspiracy theories that &quot;the EBT cards will run out.&quot;&amp;nbsp; How does a card run out?&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s a &lt;i&gt;card&lt;/i&gt;, people, not a bag of gold solidi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that&#39;s about all the time we have today.&amp;nbsp; For more context, see &lt;a href=&quot;http://evoandproud.blogspot.com/2009/08/was-christianity-responsible.html&quot;&gt;Peter Frost&lt;/a&gt;. </content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/feeds/2661313922677985710/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=7958140996781104565&amp;postID=2661313922677985710' title='88 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7958140996781104565/posts/default/2661313922677985710'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/7958140996781104565/posts/default/2661313922677985710'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2012/12/some-perspectives-from-prudentius_24.html' title='Some perspectives from Prudentius'/><author><name>Mencius Moldbug</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/16472157249344139282</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>88</thr:total></entry></feed>
