			<![CDATA[<p>Former NSA attorneys John DeLong and Susan Hennessay have <a href="https://www.lawfareblog.com/understanding-footnote-14-nsa-lawyering-oversight-and-compliance">written</a> a fascinating article describing a particular incident of oversight failure inside the NSA. Technically, the story hinges on a definitional difference between the NSA and the FISA court meaning of the word "archived." (For the record, I would have defaulted to the NSA's interpretation, which feels more accurate technically.) But while the story is worth reading, what's especially interesting are the broader issues about how a nontechnical judiciary can provide oversight over a very technical data collection-and-analysis organization -- especially if the oversight must largely be conducted in secret.</p>

<p>From the article:</p>

<blockquote><p>Broader root cause analysis aside, the BR FISA debacle made clear that the specific matter of shared legal interpretation needed to be addressed. Moving forward, the government agreed that NSA would coordinate all significant legal interpretations with DOJ. That sounds like an easy solution, but making it meaningful in practice is highly complex. Consider this example: a court order might require that "all collected data must be deleted after two years." NSA engineers must then make a list for the NSA attorneys:

<ol><li>What does deleted mean? Does it mean make inaccessible to analysts or does it mean forensically wipe off the system so data is gone forever? Or does it mean something in between?

<p><li>What about backup systems used solely for disaster recovery? Does the data need to be removed there, too, within two years, even though it's largely inaccessible and typically there is a planned delay to account for mistakes in the operational system?</p>

<p><li>When does the timer start?</p>

<p><li>What's the legally-relevant unit of measurement for timestamp computation­ -- a day, an hour, a second, a millisecond?</p>

<p><li>If a piece of data is deleted one second after two years, is that an incident of noncompliance? What about a delay of one day? ....</p>

<p><li>What about various system logs that simply record the fact that NSA had a data object, but no significant details of the actual object? Do those logs need to be deleted too? If so, how soon?</p>

<p><li>What about hard copy printouts?</ol></p>

<p>And that is only a tiny sample of the questions that need to be answered for that small sentence fragment. Put yourself in the shoes of an NSA attorney: which of these questions -- ­in particular the answers­ -- require significant interpretations to be coordinated with DOJ and which determinations can be made internally?</p>

<p>Now put yourself in the shoes of a DOJ attorney who receives from an NSA attorney a subset of this list for advice and counsel. Which questions are truly significant from your perspective? Are there any questions here that are so significant they should be presented to the Court so that that government can be sufficiently confident that the Court understands how the two-year rule is really being interpreted and applied?</p></blockquote>

<p>In many places I have separated different kinds of oversight: are we doing things right versus are we doing the right things? This is very much about the first: is the NSA complying with the rules the courts impose on them? This is about the first kind. I believe that the NSA tries very hard to follow the rules it's given, while at the same time being very aggressive about how it interprets any kind of ambiguities and using its nonadversarial relationship with its overseers to its advantage.</p>

<p>The only possible solution I can see to all of this is more public scrutiny. Secrecy is toxic here.</p>]]>

			<![CDATA[<p>On today's Internet, too much power is concentrated in too few hands. In the early days of the Internet, individuals were empowered. Now governments and corporations hold the balance of power. If we are to leave a better Internet for the next generations, governments need to rebalance Internet power more towards the individual. This means several things.</p>

<p>First, less surveillance. Surveillance has become the business model of the Internet, and an aspect that is appealing to governments worldwide. While computers make it easier to collect data, and networks to aggregate it, governments should do more to ensure that any surveillance is exceptional, transparent, regulated and targeted. It's a tall order; governments such as that of the US need to overcome their own mass-surveillance desires, and at the same time implement regulations to fetter the ability of Internet companies to do the same.</p>

<p>Second, less censorship. The early days of the Internet were free of censorship, but no more. Many countries censor their Internet for a variety of political and moral reasons, and many large social networking platforms do the same thing for business reasons. Turkey censors anti-government political speech; many countries censor pornography. Facebook has censored both nudity and videos of police brutality. Governments need to commit to the free flow of information, and to make it harder for others to censor.</p>

<p>Third, less propaganda. One of the side-effects of free speech is erroneous speech. This naturally corrects itself when everybody can speak, but an Internet with centralized power is one that invites propaganda. For example, both China and Russia actively use propagandists to influence public opinion on social media. The more governments can do to counter propaganda in all forms, the better we all are.</p>

<p>And fourth, less use control. Governments need to ensure that our Internet systems are open and not closed, that neither totalitarian governments nor large corporations can limit what we do on them. This includes limits on what apps you can run on your smartphone, or what you can do with the digital files you purchase or are collected by the digital devices you own. Controls inhibit innovation: technical, business, and social.</p>

<p>Solutions require both corporate regulation and international cooperation. They require Internet governance to remain in the hands of the global community of engineers, companies, civil society groups, and Internet users. They require governments to be agile in the face of an ever-evolving Internet. And they'll result in more power and control to the individual and less to powerful institutions. That's how we built an Internet that enshrined the best of our societies, and that's how we'll keep it that way for future generations.</p>

<p>This essay <a href="http://time.com/4525957/2016-election-internet-security/">previously appeared</a> on Time.com, in a section about <a href="http://time.com/collection/the-issues/?xid=homepage">issues</a> for the next president.

<blockquote><p>The question, boiled down, was haunting: Want to see how easy it would be to get into someone's voter registration and make changes to it? The offer from Steve Klink -- a Lafayette-based public consultant who works mainly with Indiana public school districts -- was to use my voter registration record as a case study.

<p>Only with my permission, of course.</p>

<p>"I will not require any information from you," he texted. "Which is the problem."</p>

<p>Turns out he didn't need anything from me. He sent screenshots of every step along the way, as he navigated from the "Update My Voter Registration" tab at the Indiana Statewide Voter Registration System maintained since 2010 at <a href="http://www.indianavoters.com/">www.indianavoters.com</a> to the blank screen that cleared the way for changes to my name, address, age and more.</p>

<p>The only magic involved was my driver's license number, one of two log-in options to make changes online. And that was contained in a copy of every county's voter database, a public record already in the hands of political parties, campaigns, media and, according to Indiana open access laws, just about anyone who wants the beefy spreadsheet.</p></blockquote>]]>

Last month, he <a href="http://krebsonsecurity.com/tag/ddos-for-hire/">wrote about</a> an online attack-for-hire service  that resulted in the <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/09/alleged-vdos-proprietors-arrested-in-israel/">arrest</a> of the two proprietors. In the aftermath, his site was <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/09/krebsonsecurity-hit-with-record-ddos/">taken down</a> by a massive DDoS attack.</p>

<p>In many ways, this is nothing new. Distributed denial-of-service attacks are a family of attacks that cause websites and other Internet-connected systems to crash by overloading them with traffic. The "distributed" part means that other insecure computers on the Internet -- sometimes in the millions­ -- are recruited to a botnet to unwittingly participate in the attack. The tactics are decades old; DDoS attacks are perpetrated by lone hackers trying to be annoying, criminals trying to extort money, and governments testing their tactics. There are defenses, and there are companies that offer DDoS mitigation services for hire.</p>

<p>Basically, it's a size vs. size game. If the attackers can cobble together a fire hose of data bigger than the defender's capability to cope with, they win. If the defenders can increase their capability in the face of attack, they win.</p><p>What was new about the Krebs attack was both the <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/read/15-million-connected-cameras-ddos-botnet-brian-krebs">massive scale</a> and the particular devices the attackers recruited. Instead of using traditional computers for their botnet, they <a href="https://blog.sucuri.net/2016/09/iot-home-router-botnet-leveraged-in-large-ddos-attack.html">used</a> CCTV cameras, digital video recorders, home routers, and other embedded computers attached to the Internet as part of the Internet of Things.</p>

<p>Much has been written about how the IoT is wildly insecure. In fact, the software used to attack Krebs was <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/read/internet-of-things-malware-mirai-ddos">simple and amateurish</a>. What this attack demonstrates is that the economics of the IoT mean that it will remain insecure unless government steps in to fix the problem. This is a market failure that can't get fixed on its own.</p>

<p>Our computers and smartphones are as secure as they are because there are teams of security engineers working on the problem. Companies like Microsoft, Apple, and Google spend a lot of time testing their code before it's released, and quickly patch vulnerabilities when they're discovered. Those companies can support such teams because those companies make a huge amount of money, either directly or indirectly, from their software­ -- and, in part, compete on its security. This isn't true of embedded systems like digital video recorders or home routers. Those systems are sold at a much lower margin, and are often built by offshore third parties. The companies involved simply don't have the expertise to make them secure.</p>

<p>Even worse, most of these devices <a href="https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2014/01/the_internet_of_thin.html">don't have any way to be patched</a>. Even though the source code to the botnet that attacked Krebs has been <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/10/source-code-for-iot-botnet-mirai-released/">made public</a>, we can't update the affected devices. Microsoft delivers security patches to your computer once a month. Apple does it just as regularly, but not on a fixed schedule. But the only way for you to update the firmware in your home router is to throw it away and buy a new one.</p>

<p>The security of our computers and phones also comes from the fact that we replace them regularly. We buy new laptops every few years. We get new phones even more frequently. This isn't true for all of the embedded IoT systems. They last for years, even decades. We might buy a new DVR every five or ten years. We replace our refrigerator every 25 years. We replace our thermostat approximately never. Already the banking industry is dealing with the security problems of Windows 95 embedded in ATMs. This same problem is going to occur all over the Internet of Things.</p>

<p>The market can't fix this because neither the buyer nor the seller cares. Think of all the CCTV cameras and DVRs used in the attack against Brian Krebs. The owners of those devices don't care. Their devices were cheap to buy, they still work, and they don't even know Brian. The sellers of those devices don't care: they're now selling newer and better models, and the original buyers only cared about price and features. There is no market solution because the insecurity is what economists call an externality: it's an effect of the purchasing decision that affects other people. Think of it kind of like invisible pollution.</p>

<p>What this all means is that the IoT will remain insecure unless government steps in and fixes the problem. When we have market failures, government is the only solution. The government could impose security regulations on IoT manufacturers, forcing them to make their devices secure even though their customers don't care. They could impose liabilities on manufacturers, allowing people like Brian Krebs to sue them. Any of these would raise the cost of insecurity and give companies incentives to spend money making their devices secure.</p>

<p>Of course, this would only be a domestic solution to an international problem. The Internet is global, and attackers can just as easily build a botnet out of IoT devices from Asia as from the United States. Long term, we need to build an Internet that is resilient against attacks like this. But that's a long time coming. In the meantime, you can expect more attacks that leverage insecure IoT devices.</p>
