				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><div class="pf-content"><p><a href="http://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2016/10/18/13317484/hillary-clinton-carbon-tax-wikileaks" target="_blank">From Brad Plumer at Vox</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We have done extensive polling on a carbon tax,” Podesta apparently <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/16655">told</a> Clinton adviser Jake Sullivan back in January 2015. “It all sucks.”</p></blockquote>
<p>There is further detail at that link.  A quite remarkable <a href="http://www.vox.com/2016/10/18/13012394/i-732-carbon-tax-washington" target="_blank">David Roberts piece at Vox</a>, worth reading in its entirety, lays out why much of &#8220;the left&#8221; opposes the carbon tax on the ballot in Washington state.  It is revenue-neutral, doesn&#8217;t produce enough social justice, and as I would say it doesn&#8217;t have the right mood affiliation, among other factors.  Economist Yoram Bauman plays a key role in the article, and here is a quotation from him:</p>
<blockquote><p>I am increasingly convinced that the path to climate action is through the Republican Party. Yes, there are challenges on the right — skepticism about climate science and about tax reform — but those are surmountable with time and effort. The same cannot be said of the challenges on the left: an unyielding desire to tie everything to bigger government, and a willingness to use race and class as political weapons in order to pursue that desire.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m not so sure about that portrayal of the Republicans, but still that is a perspective you don&#8217;t hear enough.  (Scott Sumner <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2016/10/global_warming_14.html" target="_blank">comments on the piece</a>.)  You may recall <a href="http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2016/03/core-differences-republicans-democrats.html" target="_blank">my earlier post on Republicans and Democrats</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>At some level the Republicans might know the Democrats have valid substantive points, but they sooner think “Let’s first put status relations in line, then our debates might get somewhere.  In the meantime, I’m not going to cotton well to a debate designed to lower the status of the really important groups and their values.”  And so the dialogue doesn’t get very far.</p></blockquote>
<p>To return more directly to the title of this post, why don&#8217;t we have a carbon tax?  I would put it this way: for better or worse, the American people expect their government to solve this problem without raising the price of energy.  Funny that.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><div class="pf-content"><blockquote><p>Dancers are notoriously bad at planning for their second acts. They underestimate the age at which they&#8217;ll retire (the average age of retirement is 34), overestimate the amount of money they&#8217;ll earn, and misjudge the forces that will end their careers. More than one-third of the dancers in a 2004 <a class="body-el-link longform-body-el-link" href="http://www.cpanda.org/data/a00191/changes.pdf">survey</a> were driven to retirement by an injury; only 5 percent left because they actually wanted a new career. When dancers enter the workforce in their thirties, many are woefully unprepared. Only 3 percent of current dancers say that teaching dance is their preferred post-retirement line of work, but it&#8217;s the most common fate: 53 percent end up teaching dance in some capacity.</p></blockquote>
<p>And this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Even during peak earning years: in the U.S., an average dancer&#8217;s annual total income is just $35,000—about half of which comes from non-dance activities.</p></blockquote>
<p>The article is interesting throughout, for instance:</p>
<blockquote><p>She wants a serious relationship; both of her sisters are married. She&#8217;s tried Tinder and recently joined Bumble. For obvious reasons, she doesn&#8217;t like the apps that make you fill in your whole biography. Does she miss her old life—the drama, the spotlight? &#8220;I don&#8217;t think real life has enough glamour,&#8221; she says. But she also says that she doesn&#8217;t think glamour is &#8220;enough to base your life on.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>That is from <a href="http://www.elle.com/culture/a39990/alexandra-ansanelli-prima-ballerina-career/" target="_blank">an Alice Robb <em>Elle</em> profile of Alexandra Ansanelli</a>, a ballerina who retired early, via <a href="https://twitter.com/AnnieLowrey" target="_blank">Annie Lowrey</a>.</p>

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="522" data-total-count="4873">That’s why the results of a recent study of <a href="http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/35/7/1160.abstract">new plans offered in California</a> are especially troubling. Simon Haeder, a West Virginia University political scientist, and colleagues at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and the University of California, Irvine, found that access to primary care physicians was relatively poor for a sample of plans offered through California’s Affordable Care Act Marketplace in 2015. <a href="http://ldi.upenn.edu/sites/default/files/pdf/state-narrow-networks.pdf">Most Obamacare marketplace plans in California</a>, as well as in other states, are narrow network plans.</p>
<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="336" data-total-count="5209">Using a “secret shopper” approach, the study found that only about 30 percent of attempts for appointments with specific primary care doctors were successful. In this approach, an individual pretending to be a patient seeking an appointment called the offices of over 700 primary care doctors listed in marketplace plan directories.</p>
<p id="story-continues-2" class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="432" data-total-count="5641">In about 15 percent of cases, the doctor did not accept the caller’s plan, despite being listed in its directory. In nearly 20 percent of cases, the directory included the wrong phone number or the number was busy in two calls on consecutive days. Ten percent of doctors called were not accepting new patients. And about 30 percent of doctors called were not primary care physicians, despite being listed as such in the directory.</p>
<p>When callers were able to make an appointment, the average waiting time for a physical exam was about three weeks. In cases for which the caller pretended to have acute symptoms, the average time until an appointment was about one and a half weeks.</p></blockquote>
<p>That is <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/18/upshot/savings-yes-but-narrow-health-networks-also-show-troubling-signs.html?smid=tw-upshotnyt&amp;smtyp=cur&amp;_r=0" target="_blank">from Austin Frakt</a> (NYT).  It seems to be an example of the kind of rationing many of us predicted for Obamacare, although I would like to see the comparable numbers for the pre-ACA years.  The piece has other points of interest, mostly about cost savings, which seem to be real.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><div class="pf-content"><blockquote><p>Authoritarian leaders are seen as far more trustworthy than politicians in more openly democratic countries across the emerging world, according to data compiled by the <a href="https://www.ft.com/topics/organisations/World_Economic_Forum" data-trackable="link">World Economic Forum</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/9b62523e-75cd-11e6-bf48-b372cdb1043a" data-trackable="link">Leaders </a>in Singapore, the Gulf states and Rwanda are rated as having the highest ethical standards in the emerging markets, closely followed by their Chinese and central Asian counterparts.</p>
<p>In contrast, politicians in democracies such as Brazil, Paraguay, Nigeria, Mexico and Romania are seen as exhibiting the lowest ethical standards.</p>
<p>“It does look counterintuitive,” says Thierry Geiger, head of analytics and quantitative research at the WEF, which has polled local and expatriate business communities in 138 countries on the issue since 2007 as part of its annual Global Competitiveness Report.</p>
<p>One of the biggest losers in the WEF’s “trust in politicians” ranking over this period has been Tunisia, widely regarded as the sole success story of the 2011 Arab uprisings. Its politicians were ranked as the 15th most trustworthy in the world in 2010, before the overthrow of President Zein al-Abidine Ben Ali. Under democratic rule, the country has fallen to 63rd.</p>
<p>Other countries that saw sharp falls in the ranking include the democracies of South Africa, Barbados, South Korea, Iceland, Cyprus and Spain.</p>
<p>Overall, among the 20 emerging market countries rated as having the most trustworthy politicians in the 2016 survey, 13 are rated as “not free” by Freedom House, a US government-funded non-governmental organisation, with three classed as partly free and just four classed as free.</p>
<p>Among the 20 emerging markets whose politicians are seen as having the lowest ethical standards, not one is classed by Freedom House as not free, with six free and 14 partly free.</p></blockquote>
<p>That is <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/79d1ce36-8ca9-11e6-8aa5-f79f5696c731" target="_blank">from Steve Johnson at the FT</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><div class="pf-content"><blockquote><p>It is tempting, among those of us who would be appalled by a Trump victory, to try to sway undecided voters by equating voting for Trump with racism full-stop. That’s a bad idea. If it becomes the mainstream view that Trump voters are simply racists, it leaves those who are already committed, those who are unwilling to abandon Trump or to stomach Clinton, little choice but to own what they’ve been accused of. Racist is the new queer. The same daring, transgressional psychology that, for gay people, converted an insult into a durable token of identity may persuade a mass of people who otherwise would not have challenged the social taboo surrounding racism to accept the epithet with defiant equanimity or even to embrace it. The assertion that Trump’s supporters are all racists has, I think, become partially self-fulfilling. In and of itself, that will make America’s already deeply ugly racial politics uglier. It will help justify the further <a href="http://www.interfluidity.com/v2/5876.html" target="_blank">pathologization</a> of the emerging white underclass while doing nothing at all to help communities of color except, conveniently for some, to set the groups at one another’s throats so they cannot make common cause. It will become yet another excuse for beneficiaries of economic stratification to blame its victims. Things were bad before this election. They are worse now, and we should be very careful about how we carry this experience forward. These are frightening times.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here is <a href="http://www.interfluidity.com/v2/6632.html" target="_blank">more</a>, interesting throughout.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><div class="pf-content"><blockquote><p>Overall, our results suggest that investing in secure payments infrastructure can significantly enhance “state capacity” to implement welfare programs in developing countries.</p></blockquote>
<p>That is from Muralidharan, Niehaus, and Sukhtankar <a href="http://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/aer.20141346" target="_blank">in the latest American Economic Review</a>.  Their main result is this:</p>
<blockquote><p>We find that, while incompletely implemented, the new system delivered a faster, more predictable, and less corrupt NREGS payments process without adversely affecting program access.</p></blockquote>
<p>Most of all there is lower leakage of benefits, and program participants strongly prefer the biometric arrangements and the accompanying direct cash transfers.  The measurements of this paper, by the way, are based on 19 million data points.</p>
<p>I believe the Indian biometric smartcard initiative remains under-discussed and underappreciated.  It is actually one of the greatest achievements of contemporary times, based upon the innovative mobilization of the labor of millions in a manner that probably only India could do and that at first sounded quite ridiculous.  Scan, record, and use the biometric information of over a billion people, and in a &#8220;backward&#8221; country at that.  Well, they haven&#8217;t finished but it is well on track to succeed.</p>
<p>I do worry about the privacy implications of the technology and the data collection, but as it stands today so many Indians don&#8217;t have that much privacy in any case.</p>
<p>Here are <a href="https://www.google.com/#q=Building+State+Capacity:+Evidence+from+Biometric+Smartcards+in+India" target="_blank">ungated versions of the paper</a>.  Here is <a href="http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2014/03/how-is-the-biomarker-id-aid-plan-going-in-india.html" target="_blank">my earlier post on the paper and the technology</a>.  I had written:</p>
<blockquote><p>One broader lesson here is that developing nations are not merely copying and applying the inventions of the West, but innovating on their own.  But a lot of their innovations take labor-intensive rather than capital-intensive forms, and thus they do not always look like innovations to our sometimes ethnocentric eyes.</p></blockquote>
<p>Still true.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><div class="pf-content"><blockquote><p>&#8230;the NFL is seeing its ratings tumble in the same way that the Olympics, awards shows and other live events have, falling more than 10 percent for the first five weeks of the season compared with the first five weeks of last season. A continued slide, executives say, could pose an even bigger danger: If football can’t survive the new age of TV, what can?</p>
<p>Football’s traditional TV audience “is never going to be what it was again,” said Brian Hughes, a senior vice president at Magna Global, which tracks audience and advertising trends.</p>
<p>The explosion of modern entertainment options, offered on more devices and at any time, has splintered American audiences and sped TV’s decline, Hughes said. “Sports seemed to be immune from it — it was live, the last bastion of broadcast television. But [the world] has caught up to it now.”</p></blockquote>
<p>That is <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/nfl-ratings-plunge-could-spell-doom-for-traditional-tv/2016/10/14/a7a23dc2-915f-11e6-9c85-ac42097b8cc0_story.html?hpid=hp_rhp-top-table-main_nfl-720pm%3Ahomepage%2Fstory" target="_blank">from Drew Harwell</a>, and much of the decline seems to be coming from cord-cutting, audience fragmentation, and also the presence of a somewhat controversial election season, which has drawn some viewers (not me) to cable news.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><div class="pf-content"><blockquote><p>The founding father of Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew, credits ‘social discipline’ for the phenomenal economic rise of his country (Sen, 1999). Countries such as Singapore apparently demonstrate that autocratic measures are probably necessary, particularly in culturally fractionalized societies for creating the social stability necessary for economic growth (Colletta et al., 2001). Such thinking informs the so-called “Asian model” (Diamond, 2008).1 Recent studies, particularly in economics, support the logic (Alesina et al., 2006 and Easterly et al., 2006). According to these scholars, the more congruent territorial borders are with nationality, the better the chances for good economic policy to appear endogenously from within these societies because social cohesion determines good institutions and policies for development (Banerjee et al., 2005 and Easterly, 2006b). This paper addresses the question of whether or not social diversity hampers the adoption of sound economic policies, including institutions that promote property rights and the rule of law. We also examine whether democracy conditions diversity&#8217;s effect on sound economic management, defined as economic freedom, because the index of economic freedom is strongly associated with higher growth and is endorsed by proponents of the ‘diversity deficit’ argument (Easterly, 2006a).2</p>
<p>&#8230;Using several measures of diversity, we find that higher levels of ethno-linguistic and cultural fractionalization are conditioned positively on higher economic growth by an index of economic freedom, which is often heralded as a good measure of sound economic management. High diversity in turn is associated with higher levels of economic freedom. We do not find any evidence to suggest that high diversity hampers change towards greater economic freedom and institutions supporting liberal policies.</p></blockquote>
<p>Paper <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0049089X15300260">here</a>. The data is a panel from 116 countries covering 1980–2012 so this doesn&#8217;t rule out a negative long-run effect but it is prima facie evidence that diversity need not reduce freedom or growth.</p>

If you could get everyone to read one book, <a href="http://kottke.org/16/10/if-you-could-get-everybody-to-read-one-book-what-would-it-be" target="_blank">what would it be</a>?  I find most of the listed answers strange, and overly specific, and dependent on the readers already knowing plenty of other books.  Surely your selection needs to be a bestseller if indeed by &#8220;everyone&#8221; you mean <em>everyone</em>.  I find The Bible, Krishnamurti&#8217;s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Think-These-Things-Jiddu-Krishnamurti/dp/0060916095/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1476557790&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=krishnamurti" target="_blank">Think on These Things</a>, or even <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Jonathan-Livingston-Seagull-Richard-Bach/dp/147679331X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1476557900&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=jonathan+livingston+seagull" target="_blank">Jonathan Livingston Seagull</a>, or perhaps a book about the enjoyment of sex, to be more plausible picks.  Which book would you recommend?</p>
