# smoke-signal

A simple web-based RSS reader.

## Setup

`smoke-signal` requires Python 3 and the JavaScript libraries babel, react and
react-dom. Install the Python dependencies with `pip install -r
requirements.txt`. If you have npm, you can install the JavaScript dependencies
with `npm install`.

Create a configuration file in `instance/config.py`. At the moment no special
configuration is necessary, so you can just do `mkdir instance && cp config.py
instance/`.

You can run the `opml_import.py` script on an OPML file to import a list of
feeds. There's a sample at `sample.opml`.

## TODO

The reader is very simple as of now; at the moment, my priority is to get it
decent enough that I'll be willing to use it instead of The Old Reader.

Later, I want to add some extensibility: the ability to add your own script to
fetch a feed, à la Liferea. Surprisingly, there are still websites that don't
have an RSS feed in 2016.
