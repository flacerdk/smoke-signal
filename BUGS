Clicking on a feed name to display its entries only shows entries already saved
in the database; fetching newer entries requires refreshing. This is currently
done in order to avoid fetching it again all the time. In the future there'll be
a smarter way to do this, or at least a button to refresh all feeds at once.

Right now, entries just show the content of the <description> element
verbatim. That is, there's no HTML parsing. We could just strip all tags, but
ideally, we should strip potentially dangerous tags while leaving harmless ones
in.

There's essentially no styling yet, so the website looks very ugly.
